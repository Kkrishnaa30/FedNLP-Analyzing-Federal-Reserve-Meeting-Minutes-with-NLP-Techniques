McKay, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisDevelopments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) turned first to a discussion of financial developments. Over the intermeeting period, there were significant swings in asset prices, and financial conditions tightened, on net, as market participants assessed incoming information about the economy. In the United States, near-term policy rate expectations shifted markedly toward the end of the period, particularly after the release of the May consumer price index (CPI) report. Ahead of the release of the report, market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be 50 basis point rate increases at both the June and July FOMC meetings. After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well. Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook.Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury securities ended the period significantly higher, primarily reflecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period. Market participants reported that while liquidity conditions in the market for Treasury securities had been affected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall market functioning had held up. Responding to higher interest rates and some concerns about the growth outlook, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period.The manager turned next to a discussion of developments related to foreign central banks. Most major foreign central banks were proceeding on a path of removing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Several\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094had raised their policy rates 50 basis points over the intermeeting period, and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tightening in order to address inflation risks. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced an end to its asset purchase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in July. Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accommodative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve control target. On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies.Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effective federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates. The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the period. Contacts attributed the downward pressure on secured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevated uncertainty about the interest rate path, which had increased demand for short-term investments. In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in overnight private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider further lifting the per-counterparty limit. Over the longer term, ON RRP usage was expected to fall, with the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate.The deputy manager turned next to a discussion of Federal Reserve operations and related topics. In accordance with the directive to the Open Market Desk, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings began in June, under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $17.5 billion for agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under current staff projections, the SOMA portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly $400 billion by the end of 2022. As noted in the recent SOMA annual report and reported in the Board's first-quarter financial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unrealized loss, reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates. Unrealized losses had no implications for Federal Reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached maturity. The staff projected that SOMA net income would decline and potentially turn negative, with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some liabilities, and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Neither unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve's existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would impair the implementation of monetary policy or the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.On other operational matters, the deputy manager noted that, over the intermeeting period, the Desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility (SRF), resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved, to date, as SRF counterparties.By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information available at the time of the June 14\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quarter. The labor market remained very tight, but there were some signs that momentum was slowing. Consumer price inflation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as measured by the 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May.Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the increases were widespread across industries.Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period. Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer-run rate of 2 percent.Production and spending indicators were mixed but generally remained strong. Consumer spending and industrial production posted sizable gains in April. However, retail sales declined in May, data on home sales and single-family housing starts moved down in April, some indicators of manufacturing activity weakened in May, and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary June reading. Supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors (such as general merchandise retailers) but to have deteriorated in others (such as materials for home construction). On balance, the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the second quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter.Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. By contrast, real goods exports grew in both March and April after declining in the previous two months, following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and pharmaceuticals, which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April.Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth. In China, activity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on economic activity. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to have an imprint on foreign activity, with persistent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence, especially in Europe. Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further increases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services. Central banks around the world further tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation.Staff Review of the Financial SituationOver the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher on net. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined considerably, on balance, amid elevated market volatility. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), sovereign yields also increased further, and foreign equity price indexes moved lower. Despite further increases in borrowing costs, financing conditions in domestic credit markets remained generally accommodative. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the outlook for credit quality had begun to deteriorate somewhat.Since the previous FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields increased considerably on net. Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings. However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely being interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. The expected federal funds rate path\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094also increased notably on balance. Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net. The stock price declines were largely associated with mixed corporate earnings news early in the period and increasing concerns about the economic outlook amid global policy tightening. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the VIX\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094increased moderately, on balance, remaining elevated relative to its historical distribution and significantly above average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on investment-grade and, to a greater extent, speculative-grade corporate bonds widened notably, on net, reaching levels comparable with those at the end of 2018. This widening of spreads was associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening. Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the May increase in the Federal Reserve's administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money market rates. Spreads on longer-tenor commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed moderately, with no signs of spillovers beyond the stablecoin market following the collapse of a large algorithmic stablecoin. Indeed, CP outstanding increased slightly over the period. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Secured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meeting, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility increased further.Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeeting period amid investors' concerns about further inflationary pressures and major central banks' policy communications suggesting a firmer stance of policy. Interest rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with increased uncertainty about the path of policy rates. Concerns about the global growth outlook weighed on equity prices, and the broad dollar edged up. Implied equity price volatility remained at elevated levels. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro-area peripheral countries widened further. These moves were partially retraced following an unscheduled meeting of the ECB on June 15, at which the ECB indicated that it would take action to address potential fragmentation risk in euro-area sovereign bond markets. Outflows from emerging market-dedicated funds intensified in early May, especially from local currency bond funds, and credit spreads in emerging market economies widened moderately.In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. Credit remained widely available, particularly to higher-rated firms and consumers with higher credit scores. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, especially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance decelerated and initial public offering volumes remained extremely slow in May, while gross issuance of municipal bonds remained robust.Commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks' balance sheets expanded at a rapid pace in April and May. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Small business loan originations through April were in line with pre-pandemic levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available.Residential mortgage credit remained widely available through May for most borrowers. While refinance volumes continued trending lower in April and May amid higher mortgage rates, outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade, likely reflecting a substitution by homeowners away from cash-out refinances. In consumer credit markets, auto loans outstanding grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, consistent with a rebound in auto sales, but slowed in April and May. Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May.Borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sectors since the previous FOMC meeting. Yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds remained well above pre-pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institutional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both April and May. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting period, in line with the increases in MBS and Treasury yields, reaching their highest levels since 2010. In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward.Despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in April, in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the volume of upgrades. In addition, market indicators of future default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent, as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook.Credit quality of business loans on banks' books remained sound, with C&I and CRE delinquency rates continuing to be low through March. Nonetheless, banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. Delinquency rates on CMBS and small business loans continued to decline, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong.Household credit quality remained solid, with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near historical lows. In addition, mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months. While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account holders with below-prime credit scores inched up from low levels. The sizable increases in credit card purchase volumes through March were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments, thus increasing household borrowing only slightly.Staff Economic OutlookThe projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection. The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year. However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2022 and for 2023. The level of real GDP was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year. Labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight, albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection.With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to stronger-than-expected wage growth and the staff's assessment that the boost to inflation from supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than previously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances were projected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints. Similarly, core inflation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024.The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The staff judged that the ongoing war in Ukraine remained a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse developments associated with China's zero-COVID policy were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad.Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In addition, participants indicated that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks.With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment appeared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. Correspondingly, participants indicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment and price stability. An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Participants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improvement in supply constraints, and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of policy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors.In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that consumption spending had remained robust, in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market. Several participants noted that household spending patterns appeared to be shifting away from goods to services. Several participants indicated that some of their contacts reported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Participants generally expected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales, and a couple of participants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably. Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer sentiment had dropped notably in June, according to the preliminary reading in the Michigan survey.With respect to the business sector, participants observed that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook. In many industries, the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain disruptions. Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and agricultural producers' ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expanding their production capacity. Similarly, a few participants noted that, in other sectors of the economy, their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and financing costs. With supply challenges still widespread, contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant, and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time.Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. These indicators included an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage growth. Additionally, most business contacts had continued to report persistent wage pressures as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, some contacts reported that, because of previous wage hikes, hiring and retention had improved and pressure for additional wage increases appeared to be receding.Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust. Several participants observed that labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level because of the unusually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was unlikely to move up considerably in the near term. A couple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity.While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices. As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appropriate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market. With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to diminish over time, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a gradual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024. In light of the very high level of job vacancies, a number of participants judged that the expected moderation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate.Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, with total PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. They also observed that the 12-month change in the CPI in May came in above expectations. Participants were concerned that the May CPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating, and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persistent than they had previously anticipated. They commented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation, with low- and moderate-income households especially affected. These households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food, energy, and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate-income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, together with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and services. They noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and putting additional upward pressure on inflation. Participants commented on the global nature of inflation pressures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy. Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector. Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submissions, largely in response to higher-than-expected inflation readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints. They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Committee's longer-run objectives by 2024 and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expectations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey. With respect to market-based measures, however, a few participants noted that medium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures were unchanged. While measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants were generally judged to be broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run 2 percent inflation objective, many participants raised the concern that longer-run inflation expectations could be beginning to drift up to levels inconsistent with the 2 percent objective. These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee's objective.In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations. Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices. Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated. In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals recently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy's underlying momentum. Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the downside. Downside risks included the possibility that a further tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China would have larger-than-expected effects on economic growth.In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation was well above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective, and the near-term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meeting. Against this backdrop, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting. One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points. All participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time.In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee's objectives. In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting. Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.Participants noted that, with the federal funds rate expected to be near or above estimates of its longer-run level later this year, the Committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments. They also remarked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Many participants noted that the Committee's credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Participants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected.At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee's legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk management perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected. Many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as warranted. On this matter, participants stressed that appropriate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in restoring price stability.Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-related lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis.Committee Policy ActionIn their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. With the effects of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia already materializing, members considered it appropriate to omit from the June statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the U.S. economy. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, members agreed that the Committee would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent at this meeting.Members judged that, with high and widespread inflation pressures and some measures of longer-term inflation expectations moving up somewhat, it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market conditions, members also agreed to remove the previous statement language that had indicated an expectation that appropriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market.Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 1.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 1.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBSreceived in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month.Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.\\\"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter.

Wood, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, BoardRebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, BoardRecent Developments in the Banking SectorBefore turning to other agenda items, the Chair asked the Vice Chair for Supervision to provide an update on recent developments in the banking sector. The Vice Chair for Supervision described the developments, including those at Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Credit Suisse. He also described actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies in response. He noted that the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. He also noted that he will be leading a review of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, and that the Federal Reserve System will apply what is learned from the review to strengthen its supervisory and regulatory practices as appropriate.Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager turned first to a review of U.S. financial market developments over the intermeeting period. Early in the period, firmer-than-expected data and policy communications pushed interest rates higher and equity prices lower. Developments in the banking sector later in the period were met with sharp reductions in Treasury yields, particularly at shorter tenors. Treasury market liquidity was poor and implied volatility was high, but the market remained functional amid substantial trading activity. Higher Treasury market volatility contributed to wider spreads for household and business borrowing.Financial conditions tightened considerably over the intermeeting period as a whole. Market contacts observed that the recent developments in the banking system will likely result in a pullback in bank lending, which would not be reflected in most common financial conditions indexes. Following the banking-sector developments, equity prices for large U.S. banks underperformed the broad market; equity prices for U.S. regional banks generally underperformed by relatively more.Regarding the outlook for inflation in the United States, market-based measures of inflation compensation over shorter horizons rose over the period, al\\u00adthough compensation retraced a good portion of its increase later in the period as markets reacted to the developments in the banking sector. Forward inflation compensation measures continued to indicate that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. Measures of inflation expectations from the Open Market Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants moved higher at shorter horizons and were little changed at longer horizons.Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, market-based measures of policy expectations suggested that the federal funds rate would reach a peak in May 2023 and that the target range would then move lower. However, the medians of respondents' modal expectations of the federal funds rate from the Desk surveys did not show any declines in the target range through the end of 2023. Risk and liquidity premiums embedded in market prices may have driven a good part of the difference between survey and market measures. The median respondent expected the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 and 2024 to shift 25 basis points higher. However, information gathered after the Desk surveys closed suggests that those expectations had declined some, to a level comparable with the December SEP. Survey responses suggested only modest changes in expectations for balance sheet policy.The manager turned next to a discussion of operations and money markets. Federal funds volumes fell sharply for a few days late in the period as Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) sought to maintain liquidity in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks. Money market rates remained broadly stable, and secured and unsecured money market rates, including the effective fed funds rate, traded well within the target range. Use of U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks had been minimal, indicating that market participants did not face significant difficulties in obtaining dollar funding from private sources.Borrowing from the new Bank Term Funding Program had been small relative to discount window borrowing, which had increased to record levels. Use of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility fell, especially for money market mutual funds (MMFs), as the supply of short-term securities at attractive rates increased.By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information available at the time of the March 21\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009322 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained tight in January and February, with robust job gains and the unemployment rate near a historical low. Consumer price inflation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094was still elevated in January. Real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter. Al\\u00adthough financial market data had shown reactions to developments in the banking sector late in the intermeeting period, there were essentially no economic data available that covered this period.Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster monthly pace in January and February than in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment rate was little changed and stood at 3.6 percent in February. Over the past two months, the unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged, on net, and the unemployment rate for Hispanics moved up; the unemployment rates for both groups remained above the aggregate measure. The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased slightly. The private-sector job openings rate in January\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094was little changed, on balance, since November and remained high.Recent indicators of nominal wage growth had slowed but continued to be elevated. In February, the 3-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, slower than its 12-month pace of 4.6 percent. Over the four quarters of 2022, total labor compensation per hour in the business sector\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as measured by the Productivity and Costs data\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094increased 4.5 percent, below its pace in the previous year.Consumer price inflation remained elevated early in the year. Total PCE price inflation was 5.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January, and core PCE price inflation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094was 4.7 percent. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.6 percent in January. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 6.0 percent, and core CPI inflation was 5.5 percent. The CPI, along with data from the producer price index, pointed to some slowing in PCE price inflation in February. The latest survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months, while near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down.Real GDP growth seemed to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter. Gains in consumer spending had picked up in recent months, but growth in business fixed investment was slowing and residential investment was continuing to decline. After contracting over the second half of last year, manufacturing output expanded moderately, on average, over January and February, but near-term indicators\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094such as national and regional indexes for new orders\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094pointed to softening factory output in the coming months.The nominal U.S. international trade deficit registered a record high in 2022. The trade deficit had been narrowing since March of last year but resumed widening in December and January. Real goods imports rose in December and January, led by increases in imports of consumer goods and automotive products. Real goods exports also increased, but by less than imports.Indicators suggested that foreign economic growth rebounded in the first quarter of 2023 as China reopened rapidly from its COVID-19-related shutdowns and Europe's economy proved to be resilient to the energy price shock stemming from Russia's war against Ukraine and benefited from a mild winter that reduced energy demand. Manufacturing activity in emerging Asia showed signs of a turnaround from its pronounced slowdown since mid-2022. The recent developments in the banking sector led to some tightening of financial conditions abroad. Oil prices edged down despite China's rapid reopening and the implementation of the European Union's embargo on Russian refined oil products. Retail energy inflation continued to slow, contributing to an easing of headline consumer price inflation in many advanced foreign economies (AFEs). In contrast, core inflation has shown little sign of easing in most foreign economies amid tight labor markets. In response, many foreign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening, al\\u00adthough some have either paused or indicated that a pause soon was possible, citing the importance of assessing the cumulative effects of past policy rate increases.Staff Review of the Financial SituationOver the first several weeks of the intermeeting period, incoming economic data and FOMC communications appeared to refocus market participants on upside risks to inflation and policy rates, with the market-implied policy rate path steepening, nominal Treasury yields rising, near-term inflation compensation measures increasing, and broad stock market price indexes declining. Financing conditions for businesses, households, and municipalities had tightened during this period and were moderately restrictive overall, as borrowing costs increased notably with the expected path of policy rates and Treasury yields and as some lenders appeared to tighten nonprice borrowing terms. Nonetheless, lending volumes were generally solid. Credit quality was strong overall, al\\u00adthough it had worsened a bit for some borrowers. Expectations for future credit quality continued to deteriorate in some markets.Pricing in financial markets changed notably in the latter part of the intermeeting period, amid developments in the banking sector. Treasury yields and policy rate expectations moved down significantly, while broad stock price indexes rose somewhat. The market-implied policy rate path shifted down sizably, with the federal funds rate expected to peak in May before decreasing afterward. Further out, OIS (overnight index swap) quotes at the end of the intermeeting period indicated that the expected federal funds rate at year-end 2024 was 3.28 percent, about 50 basis points lower than before the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank but somewhat higher than at the time of the February FOMC meeting. Treasury yields declined, especially at shorter maturities, reflecting downward revisions in policy rate expectations and the effects of flight to safety. Inflation compensation declined, especially at short maturities, likely reflecting, in part, a relatively larger decline in risk premiums on nominal Treasury securities relative to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities due to strong safe-haven demands.Late in the intermeeting period, U.S. bank stock prices declined notably. Regional banks with unusually large reliance on uninsured deposits and holdings of securities with significant unrealized mark-to-market losses experienced larger declines in stock prices. Broad equity prices rose somewhat after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, reportedly driven by investors' reassessment of the outlook for interest rates, and after the announcement that UBS had agreed to buy Credit Suisse. The VIX\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094increased to about 26.5 percent following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but it subsequently declined to 21 percent\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094around the 70th percentile of its historical distribution. Swaption-implied volatilities of short-term interest rates increased notably during this period, reflecting increased uncertainty about the interest rate outlook. Some of the pricing moves in asset markets may have been amplified by impaired liquidity conditions. Despite deteriorating liquidity conditions in Treasury, bond, and equity markets, market functioning remained orderly.Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were volatile as investors' focus shifted from resilience in economic activity and stubbornly high core inflation across advanced economies earlier in the period to stresses in the global banking sector more recently. Earlier in the period, yields and market-based measures of inflation expectations in the AFEs increased notably, driven by spillovers from U.S. Treasury yields as well as upside surprises in economic and inflation data for AFEs. Later in the period, developments in the banking sector led to large declines in advanced-economy yields, and, on net, AFE yields declined slightly. Additionally, for the intermeeting period overall, the staff's dollar index rose moderately, corporate and emerging market economy sovereign credit spreads widened, and foreign equity indexes generally moved lower, with bank equities falling notably.U.S. unsecured funding markets showed some signs of pressure later in the intermeeting period. Issuance of commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) dropped a touch over the entire period, and the fraction of CP issuance with overnight maturities increased but remained within normal ranges. Spreads of term CP and NCDs widened some, and spreads for issuers with lower credit ratings rose more, but other unsecured spreads remained within normal ranges. Prime MMFs experienced outflows, while government MMFs had inflows.The effective federal funds rate was little changed after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Amid these developments, federal funds volumes initially declined sharply as the FHLBs reduced their activity in the federal funds market in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks; market volume subsequently rebounded partially. Activity in the repurchase agreement market was robust, and trading volume remained within recent ranges. ON RRP take-up remained within recent ranges as well.Borrowing costs for businesses, households, and municipalities rose notably in the early part of the intermeeting period, mostly in line with increases in the federal funds rate and Treasury yields. Since the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, spreads on corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and leveraged loans rose, with speculative-grade corporate bond spreads registering the largest moves; spreads remained at moderate levels relative to their historical distributions. Investment-grade corporate yields and municipal yields were down moderately, whereas speculative-grade corporate yields and leveraged loan yields were up modestly. Mortgage rates were unchanged amid an increase in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) spreads.Based on data that do not cover the period following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, nonprice terms and standards appeared to tighten somewhat in a number of markets. Nevertheless, generally solid funding flows suggest that most firms and households had remained broadly able to access funding. Data on credit conditions following the developments in the banking sector were limited. After the two bank closures, issuance of municipal bond and leveraged loans was sluggish, and gross issuance of corporate bonds fell to near zero. Mortgage loans to households remained available.The credit quality of businesses and households was largely stable over the intermeeting period. However, measures of credit performance showed some signs of weakening. Leveraged loan credit quality deteriorated somewhat after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Credit quality for residential mortgages remained unchanged.Staff Economic OutlookFor some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market. Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff's projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years. Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff's estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the January projection. The level of real output was projected to move below the staff's estimate of potential output in early 2024, more than a year sooner than in the previous projection. Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff's estimate of its natural rate early next year.On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was forecast to be 2.8 percent this year, with core inflation at 3.5 percent. Core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued; housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, while core nonhousing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further. Reflecting the effects of less projected tightness in product and labor markets, core inflation was forecast to slow sharply next year. With steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was projected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years. In 2024 and 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent.The staff judged that the uncertainty around the baseline projection was much greater than at the time of the previous forecast. In particular, the staff viewed the risks around the baseline projection as determined importantly by banking conditions and the implications for financial conditions. If the effects of the recent developments in the banking sector on macroeconomic conditions were to abate quickly, then the risks around the baseline would be tilted to the upside for both economic activity and inflation. If banking and financial conditions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline, then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for both economic activity and inflation, particularly because historical recessions related to financial market problems tend to be more severe and persistent than average recessions.Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2023 through 2025 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. An SEP was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production. At the same time, though, participants noted that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. banking system remained sound and resilient. They commented that recent developments in the banking sector were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. Participants agreed that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks.In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that since they met in February, data on inflation, employment, and economic activity generally came in stronger than expected. They also noted, however, that the developments in the banking sector that had occurred late in the intermeeting period affected their views of the economic and policy outlook and the uncertainty surrounding that outlook. Based on incoming economic data, participants' assessments of the effects of cumulative policy firming, and their initial views on the likely economic effect of the recent banking-sector developments, participants generally expected real GDP to grow this year at a pace well below its long-run trend rate. With inflation remaining unacceptably high, participants expected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby reduce inflationary pressures. Many participants remarked that the incoming data before the onset of the banking-sector stresses had led them to see the appropriate path for the federal funds rate as somewhat higher than their assessment at the time of the December meeting. After incorporating the banking-sector developments, participants indicated that their policy rate projections were now about unchanged from December.Participants agreed that the actions taken so far by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other government agencies, as well as actions taken by foreign authorities to address banking and financial stresses outside the U.S., had helped calm conditions in the banking sector. Even with the actions, participants recognized that there was significant uncertainty as to how those conditions would evolve. Participants assessed that the developments so far would likely lead to some weakening of credit conditions, as some banks were likely to tighten lending standards amid rising funding costs and increased concerns about liquidity. Participants noted that it was too early to assess with confidence the magnitude of the effect of a credit tightening on economic activity and inflation, and that it was important to continue to closely monitor developments and update assessments of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening. Several participants noted that regional and community banks, a small number of which had come under significant stress, were important in small business and middle-market lending and were providing critical and unique financial services to many communities and industries.In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that incoming data on real consumer expenditures showed a pickup in spending in January and February. They attributed the pickup to strong job gains, rising real disposable income, and households continuing to run down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. They also noted that an atypically warm start to this year, along with challenges in seasonally adjusting data, likely contributed to the pickup in the reported data. A few participants observed that credit card delinquencies, particularly for lower-income households, had risen in the face of elevated inflation and higher nominal interest rates. Participants noted that recent developments in the banking sector and the associated rise in uncertainty would likely weigh on consumer sentiment and that increased caution on the part of consumers could restrain spending. A couple of participants observed that high-frequency measures of consumer sentiment had not yet shown a significant change following the recent developments in the banking sector, al\\u00adthough they also acknowledged that the situation was fluid.Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was being restrained by tighter financial conditions that reflected cumulative policy firming to date. Participants expected the likely tightening of credit conditions due to the recent developments in the banking sector to further weigh on investment spending. In addition, the banking-sector developments could damp business confidence and increase firms' caution, reducing their willingness to hire new workers. However, a few participants mentioned that their nonbank business contacts reported that the banking-sector developments so far had not resulted in significant changes in their hiring and capital spending plans or sales expectations, though their contacts also acknowledged increased uncertainties around their outlooks.Participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight. Job gains had picked up to a robust pace in January and February, and the unemployment rate remained low. Participants noted some signs of improvement in the imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market, including further declines in the quits rate as well as an increase in the overall labor force participation rate and the return of the prime-age participation rate to pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, participants observed that wage growth appeared to be slowing gradually amid this apparent easing in labor demand and increase in labor supply. However, participants assessed that labor demand continued to substantially exceed labor supply, and several participants pointed out that wage growth was still well above the rates that would be consistent over the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objective, given current estimates of trend productivity growth. Participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, supply and demand conditions in the labor market will come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices.With inflation still well above the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. Participants commented that recent inflation data indicated slower-than-expected progress on disinflation. In particular, they noted that revisions to the price data had indicated less disinflation at the end of last year than had been previously reported and that inflation was still quite elevated. Participants noted that, on a 12-month basis, core goods price inflation declined as supply chains continued to improve, but the pace of the decline had slowed, highlighting the still uncertain nature of the disinflationary process. Participants expected that housing services inflation would likely begin to slow in coming months, reflecting continued smaller increases, or potentially declines, in rents on new leases. Regarding prices for core services excluding housing, participants agreed that there was little evidence pointing to disinflation in this component. Participants generally judged that some more easing in labor market tightness and slowing in nominal wage growth would be necessary for sustained disinflation. Additionally, participants observed that indicators of short-term inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses had come down further, while longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored. Participants also discussed the potential effect on inflation of the developments in the banking sector. They noted that a tightening of credit conditions was likely to weigh on aggregate demand, which in turn could help reduce inflationary pressures. However, participants observed that the size of such an effect was highly uncertain.Participants generally observed that the recent developments in the banking sector had further increased the already-high level of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. Participants saw risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside. As a source of downside risk to activity, they noted the possibility that banks would reduce the supply of credit by more than expected, which could restrain economic activity significantly. Participants mentioned potential intensification of Russia's war against Ukraine as an additional source of downside risk to the economic outlook. Participants generally saw risks to inflation as weighted to the upside, though they also recognized some downside risks to inflation. As a source of upside risk to inflation, participants cited the possibility of more-persistent-than-anticipated price pressures, due to, for example, surprisingly resilient labor demand. As a source of downside risk to inflation, participants noted that if banks reduce the supply of credit by more than expected, the likely restraint on economic activity and hiring could put additional downward pressure on inflation.In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that inflation remained well above the Committee's longer-run goal of 2 percent and that the recent data on inflation provided few signs that inflation pressures were abating at a pace sufficient to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Participants also noted that recent developments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, though the extent of these effects was highly uncertain. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. All participants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, as described in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet.Several participants noted that, in their policy deliberations, they considered whether it would be appropriate to hold the target range steady at this meeting. They noted that doing so would allow more time to assess the financial and economic effects of recent banking-sector developments and of the cumulative tightening of monetary policy. However, these participants also observed that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other government agencies helped calm conditions in the banking sector and lessen the near-term risks to economic activity and inflation. Consequently, these participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range 25 basis points because of elevated inflation, the strength of the recent economic data, and their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.Some participants noted that given persistently high inflation and the strength of the recent economic data, they would have considered a 50 basis point increase in the target range to have been appropriate at this meeting in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector. However, due to the potential for banking-sector developments to tighten financial conditions and to weigh on economic activity and inflation, they judged it prudent to increase the target range by a smaller increment at this meeting. These participants noted that doing so would also allow the Committee time to better assess the effects of banking-sector developments on credit conditions and the economy as the Committee moved toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy.Participants observed that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other government agencies in the days preceding the meeting had served to calm conditions in the banking sector. Participants noted that the most significant issues appeared to have been limited to a small number of banks with poor risk-management practices and that the banking system remained sound and resilient. Participants emphasized that the Federal Reserve should use its liquidity and lender-of-last-resort tools, as well as its microprudential and macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools, to address stress in the banking sector and to mitigate future financial stability risks. Participants agreed that recent banking developments would factor into the Committee's monetary policy decisions to the extent that these developments affect the outlook for employment and inflation and the risks surrounding the outlook. Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective.In discussing the policy outlook, participants observed that inflation remained much too high and that the labor market remained tight; as a result, they anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Many participants noted that the likely effects of recent banking-sector developments on economic activity and inflation had led them to lower their assessments of the federal funds rate target range that would be sufficiently restrictive compared with assessments based solely on the recent economic data. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.In light of the highly uncertain economic outlook, participants underscored the importance of closely monitoring incoming information and assessing the implications for future monetary policy decisions. Participants noted that it would be particularly important to review incoming information regarding changes in credit conditions and credit flows as well as broader changes in financial conditions and to assess the implications for economic activity, labor markets, and inflation. Several participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy given the highly uncertain economic outlook.Participants emphasized a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy. Some participants observed that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the risk that banking-sector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity. Some participants also noted that, with inflation still well above the Committee's longer-run goal and the recent economic data remaining strong, upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook, and that maintaining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a downward path toward 2 percent would be appropriate from a risk-management perspective. Several participants noted the importance of longer-term inflation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. Participants generally agreed on the importance of closely monitoring incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook, and that they were prepared to adjust their views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in response to the incoming data and emerging risks to the economic outlook.Committee Policy ActionsIn their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production. They also concurred that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace, that the unemployment rate had remained low, and that inflation remains elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. They also agreed that recent developments were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but that the extent of these effects was uncertain.

In support of these goals, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. Members agreed that they would closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. Given recent developments, members anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Members concurred that, in determining the extent of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they remained strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.

becomes the board of governors general counsel until the selection of his successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the committee in .developments in financial markets and open market operationsthe manager of the system open market account soma reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets over the period since the june fomc meeting . the intermeeting period was relatively uneventful . bond yields in advanced economies increased moderately in part reflecting evolving market perceptions of prospects for foreign monetary policies . u.s . bond yields rose to a smaller degree and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets decreased . implied volatility in fixed income markets remained low . equity prices rose further with notable advances in indexes for emerging markets.the increase in the fomc s target range for the federal funds rate at the june meeting was reflected in other money market interest rates and the effective federal funds rate was near the middle of the new target range over the intermeeting period except on quarter end . take up at the system s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility averaged about billion . conditions in foreign exchange swap markets were fairly stable and demand at central bank dollar auctions was relatively low . the manager also reported on small value tests of open market operations which are conducted routinely to promote operational readiness.market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed . survey evidence suggested that most market participants now anticipated that the fomc would announce at its september meeting a date for implementation of a change in reinvestment policy although a couple of survey respondents expressed the view that the timing could be affected by developments regarding the federal debt ceiling . the survey results also suggested that while views were somewhat dispersed respondents typically expected effects on bond yields and spreads on mortgage backed securities from the change in reinvestment policy to be modest.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information reviewed for the july meeting showed that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in june and that real gross domestic product gdp likely expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter . the month change in overall consumer prices as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce slowed again in may both total consumer price inflation and core inflation which excludes consumer food and energy prices were running below percent . data from the consumer and producer price indexes for june suggested that both total and core pce price inflation on a month change basis remained at a pace similar to that seen in the previous month . survey\\u00e2 based measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly in june and the average monthly pace of private sector job gains over the first half of the year was essentially the same as last year . the unemployment rate edged up to . percent in june the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics declined slightly but remained above the unemployment rates for asians and for whites . in addition the median length of time that unemployed african americans had been out of work exceeded the comparable figures for whites and for hispanics a pattern that has prevailed for at least the past two decades . the overall labor force participation rate edged up in june and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose a bit . the rate of private sector job openings decreased in may after having risen for a couple of months while the quits rate and the hiring rate both increased . the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through mid\\u00e2 july . average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months ending in june about the same as over the comparable period a year earlier but a little slower than the rate of increase in late .total industrial production rose moderately on balance in may and june as an increase in the output of mines and utilities more than offset a net decline in manufacturing production . automakers assembly schedules indicated that motor vehicle production would edge down again in the third quarter likely reflecting a somewhat elevated level of dealers inventories and a slowing in the pace of vehicle sales last quarter . however broader indicators of manufacturing production such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in factory output over the near term.real pce appeared to have rebounded in the second quarter after increasing only modestly in the first quarter . much of the rebound looked to have been concentrated in spending on energy services and energy goods which was held down by unseasonably warm weather earlier in the year . the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the bureau of economic analysis to construct its estimate of pce declined in june but rose on net in the second quarter . light motor vehicle sales edged down further in june . however recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including continued gains in employment real disposable personal income and households net worth pointed to solid growth in total real pce in the near term . consumer sentiment as measured by the university of michigan surveys of consumers remained upbeat despite having moved down in early july.residential investment seemed to have declined in the second quarter . starts of both new single family homes and multifamily units rose in june but still decreased for the second quarter as a whole . the issuance of building permits for both types of housing was lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter . sales of existing homes decreased on net in may and june and new home sales in may partly reversed the previous month s decline.real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to have increased moderately in the second quarter after a solid gain in the first quarter . nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose again in may and new orders of these goods continued to exceed shipments pointing to further gains in shipments in the near term . in addition indicators of business sentiment remained upbeat . investment in nonresidential structures appeared to have risen at a markedly slower pace in the second quarter than in the first . firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining declined further in may and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector leveled out in recent weeks after increasing steadily for the past year.nominal outlays for defense through june pointed to an increase in real federal government purchases in the second quarter . however real purchases by state and local governments appeared to have declined . payrolls for state and local governments expanded during the second quarter but nominal construction spending by these governments decreased on net in april and may.the nominal u.s . international trade deficit narrowed in may with an increase in exports and a small decline in imports . export growth was led by consumer goods automotive products and services . the import decline was driven by consumer goods and automotive products . the available data suggested that net exports were a slight drag on real gdp growth in the second quarter.total u.s . consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased percent over the months ending in may . core pce price inflation was also percent over that same period . over the months ending in june the consumer price index cpi rose percent while core cpi inflation was percent . the median of inflation expectations over the next to years from the michigan survey edged up both in june and in the preliminary reading for july . other measures of longer\\u00e2 run inflation expectations were generally little changed on balance in recent months although those from the desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants had ticked down recently.incoming data suggested that economic growth continued to firm abroad especially among advanced foreign economies afes . the pickup in advanced economy demand also contributed to relatively strong growth in china and emerging asia but growth in latin america remained relatively weak partly reflecting tight monetary and fiscal policies . despite the stronger momentum of economic activity in the afes headline inflation declined sharply in the second quarter largely reflecting lower retail energy prices and core inflation stayed subdued in many afes . although inflation was also low in most emerging market economies emes it remained elevated in mexico because of rising food inflation and earlier peso depreciation.staff review of the financial situationdomestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period . u.s . equity prices rose longer term treasury yields increased slightly and the dollar depreciated . the committee s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at the june meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and market participants reportedly viewed fomc communications as largely in line with expectations . financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households generally remained supportive of growth in spending.fomc communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as broadly in line with investors expectations that the committee would continue to remove policy accommodation at a gradual pace . market participants generally interpreted the information on reinvestment policy provided in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans as consistent with their expectation that a change to reinvestment policy was likely to occur this year . market participants also took note of the summary in the june minutes of the committee s discussion of the progress toward the committee s percent longer run inflation objective and the extent to which recent softness in price data reflected idiosyncratic factors . overnight index swap rates pointed to little change in the expected path of the federal funds rate on net.yields on intermediate and longer term nominal treasury securities increased slightly over the intermeeting period . although yields fell following the publication of lower than expected cpi data yields were boosted by comments from foreign central bank officials that investors read as pointing to less accommodative monetary policies abroad than previously expected . measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation protected securities ticked up since the june fomc meeting . despite their intermeeting period gains longer term real and nominal treasury yields remained very low by historical standards apparently weighed down by accommodative monetary policies abroad and possibly by declines in the long term neutral real interest rate over recent years.broad u.s . equity price indexes rose . one\\u00e2 month ahead option implied volatility of the s p index the vix remained at historically low levels . spreads of yields on investment and speculative grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over comparable maturity treasury securities narrowed a bit on net.conditions in short term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period . reflecting the fomc s policy action in june yields on a broad set of money market instruments moved about basis points higher . however over much of the period the net increase in rates on shorter dated treasury bills was smaller reportedly reflecting a reduction in treasury bill supply.financing for large nonfinancial firms remained readily available al though debt issuance moderated . gross issuance of corporate bonds stepped down in june from a strong pace in may while issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued to be robust . commercial and industrial lending by banks remained quite weak in the second quarter . responses from the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible and that banks lending standards were little changed in recent months . the most cited reason for the lackluster loan demand was subdued investment spending by nonfinancial businesses but banks also reported that some borrowers had shifted to other sources of external financing or to internally generated funds.financing conditions for commercial real estate cre remained accommodative although the growth of cre loans on banks books slowed somewhat . respondents to the july sloos reported tightening credit standards for these loans . sloos respondents also reported that standards on cre loans were tight relative to their historical range and that on net demand for cre loans weakened in recent months . the pace of issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs through the first half of the year was similar to that seen last year . delinquency rates on loans in cmbs pools originated before the financial crisis continued to increase.financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed and flows of new credit continued at a moderate pace . however growth of mortgage loans on banks books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year . sloos respondents on net reported that standards on most residential mortgage loan categories eased slightly.consumer credit continued to grow on a year over year basis but the expansion of credit card and auto loan balances appeared to slow from the rapid pace that was evident through the end of last year . in the july sloos banks reported having tightened standards and widened spreads for credit card and auto loans on net . standards for the subprime segments of these loan types were particularly tight compared with their historical ranges . reflecting in part continued tightening of lending standards consumer loan growth at banks moderated further in the second quarter however that weakness was partially offset by more robust lending by credit unions.since the june fomc meeting the broad dollar depreciated percent weakening more against afe currencies than against eme currencies . the dollar s depreciation was driven in part by policy communications from the central banks of several afes that market participants viewed as less accommodative than expected as well as by weaker than expected cpi data in the united states . the bank of canada raised its policy rate in july . sovereign yields increased notably in canada germany and the united kingdom . changes in foreign equity indexes were mixed over the intermeeting period european equities edged lower japanese equities were little changed and eme equities increased . european peripheral sovereign bond spreads narrowed over the period reflecting in part positive sentiment related to the outcomes of the french parliamentary election greek debt negotiations and bank resolutions in italy . eme sovereign spreads were little changed on net.the staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability indicating that it continued to judge the vulnerabilities of the u.s financial system as moderate on balance . this overall assessment incorporated the staff s judgment that since the april assessment vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures had edged up from notable to elevated as asset prices remained high or climbed further risk spreads narrowed and expected and actual volatility remained muted in a range of financial markets . however the staff continued to view vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage as well as maturity and liquidity transformation as low and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate.staff economic outlookthe u.s . economic projection prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast . in particular real gdp growth which was modest in the first quarter was still expected to have stepped up to a solid pace in the second quarter and to maintain roughly the same rate of increase in the second half of the year . in this projection the staff scaled back its assumptions regarding the magnitude and duration of fiscal policy expansion in the coming years . however the effect of this change on the projection for real gdp over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and for longer term interest rates . thus as in the june projection the staff projected that real gdp would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in through . the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate over this period.the staff s forecast for consumer price inflation as measured by the change in the pce price index was revised down slightly for in response to weaker than expected incoming data for inflation . as a result inflation this year was expected to be similar in magnitude to last year with an upturn in the prices for food and non energy imports offset by a slower increase in core pce prices and weaker energy prices . beyond the forecast was little revised from the previous projection as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory . the staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the committee s longer run objective in and at percent in .the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past years . on the one hand many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than late last year on the other hand uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated . the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced . the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced . downside risks included the possibilities that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down that the dollar could appreciate substantially or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected . these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined on net over the same period . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis both overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent overall with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market were little changed on balance since the june fomc meeting . participants continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . in light of continued low recent readings on inflation participants expected that inflation on a month basis would remain somewhat below percent in the near term . however most participants judged that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term.data received over the intermeeting period reinforced earlier indications that real gdp growth had turned up after having been slow in the first quarter of this year . as anticipated growth in household spending appeared to have been stronger in the second quarter after its first quarter weakness . reports from district contacts on consumer spending were generally positive . however sales of motor vehicles had softened and automakers were reportedly adjusting production and assessing whether the underlying demand for automobiles had declined . participants noted that the fundamentals underpinning consumption growth including increases in payrolls remained solid . however the weakness in retail sales in june offered a note of caution.reports from district contacts on both manufacturing and services were also generally consistent with moderate growth in economic activity overall . construction sector contacts were generally upbeat . reports on the energy sector indicated that activity was continuing to expand albeit more slowly than previously survey evidence suggested that oil drilling remained profitable in some locations at current oil prices . the agricultural sector remained weak and some regions were experiencing drought conditions . a couple of participants had received indications from contacts that business investment spending in their districts might strengthen.nevertheless several participants noted that uncertainty about the course of federal government policy including in the areas of fiscal policy trade and health care was tending to weigh down firms spending and hiring plans . in addition a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected . it was also observed that the budgets of some state and local governments were under strain limiting growth in their expenditures . in contrast the prospects for u.s . exports had been boosted by a brighter international economic outlook.participants noted that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period . the unemployment rate rose slightly to . percent in june but remained low by historical standards . payroll gains picked up substantially in june . in addition the employment to population ratio increased . participants observed that the unemployment rate was likely close to or below its longer run normal rate and could decline further if as expected growth in output remained somewhat in excess of the potential growth rate . a few participants expressed concerns about the possibility of substantially overshooting full employment with one citing past difficulties in achieving a soft landing . district contacts confirmed tightness in the labor market but relayed little evidence of wage pressures although some firms were reportedly attempting to attract workers with a variety of nonwage benefits . the absence of sizable wage pressures also seemed to be confirmed by most aggregate wage measures . however a few participants suggested that in a tight labor market measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of less experienced workers at lower wages than those of established workers . in addition a number of participants suggested that the rate of increase in nominal wages was not low in relation to the rate of productivity growth and the modest rate of inflation.participants discussed the softness in inflation in recent months . many participants noted that much of the recent decline in inflation had probably reflected idiosyncratic factors . nonetheless pce price inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis would likely continue to be held down over the second half of the year by the effects of those factors and the monthly readings might be depressed by possible residual seasonality in measured pce inflation . still most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . many participants however saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below percent for longer than they currently expected and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside . participants agreed that a fall in longer term inflation expectations would be undesirable but they differed in their assessments of whether inflation expectations were well anchored . one participant pointed to the stability of a number of measures of inflation expectations in recent months but a few others suggested that continuing low inflation expectations may have been a factor putting downward pressure on inflation or that inflation expectations might need to be bolstered in order to ensure their consistency with the committee s longer term inflation objective.a number of participants noted that much of the analysis of inflation used in policymaking rested on a framework in which for a given rate of expected inflation the degree of upward pressures on prices and wages rose as aggregate demand for goods and services and employment of resources increased above long run sustainable levels . a few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation . however most participants thought that the framework remained valid notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tightening labor market and real gdp growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate . participants discussed possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment . these included a diminished responsiveness of prices to resource pressures a lower natural rate of unemployment the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment lags in the reaction of nominal wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening and restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models spurred by advances in technology . a couple of participants argued that the response of inflation to resource utilization could become stronger if output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels although other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little empirical support.in assessing recent developments in financial market conditions participants referred to the continued low level of longer term interest rates in particular those on u.s treasury securities . the level of such yields appeared to reflect both low expected future short term interest rates and depressed term premiums . asset purchases by foreign central banks and the federal reserve s securities holdings were also likely contributing to currently low term premiums although the exact size of these contributions was uncertain . a number of participants pointed to potential concerns about low longer term interest rates including the possibility that inflation expectations were too low that yields could rise abruptly or that low yields were inducing investors to take on excessive risk in a search for higher returns.several participants noted that the further increases in equity prices together with continued low longer term interest rates had led to an easing of financial conditions . however different assessments were expressed about the implications of this development for the outlook for aggregate demand and consequently appropriate monetary policy . according to one view the easing of financial conditions meant that the economic effects of the committee s actions in gradually removing policy accommodation had been largely offset by other factors influencing financial markets and that a tighter monetary policy than otherwise was warranted . according to another view recent rises in equity prices might be part of a broad based adjustment of asset prices to changes in longer term financial conditions importantly including a lower neutral real interest rate and therefore the recent equity price increases might not provide much additional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and services.participants also considered equity valuations in their discussion of financial stability . a couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations in addition as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability . several participants observed that the banking system was well capitalized and had ample liquidity reducing the risk of financial instability . it was noted that financial stability assessments were based on current capital levels within the banking sector and that such assessments would likely be adjusted should these measures of loss absorbing capacity change . participants underscored the need to monitor financial institutions for shifts in behavior such as an erosion of lending standards or increased reliance on unstable sources of funding that could lead to subsequent problems . in addition participants judged that it was important to look for signs that either declining market volatility or heavy concentration by investors in particular assets might create financial imbalances . a couple of participants expressed concern that smaller banks could be assuming significant risks in efforts to expand their cre lending . furthermore a couple of participants saw as possible sources of financial instability the pace of increase in real estate prices in the multifamily segment and the pattern of the lending and borrowing activities of certain government sponsored enterprises.participants agreed that the regulatory and supervisory tools developed since the financial crisis had played an important role in fostering financial stability . changes in regulation had likely helped in making the banking system more resilient to major shocks in promoting more prudent balance sheet management strategies on the part of nonbank financial institutions and in reducing the degree to which variations in lending to the private sector intensify cycles in output and in asset prices . participants agreed that it would not be desirable for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a reemergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.in their discussion of monetary policy participants reaffirmed their view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation was likely to remain appropriate to promote the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . participants commented on a number of factors that would influence their ongoing assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate . most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed from their earlier projections and continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . however some participants expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation which had occurred even as resource utilization had tightened and noted their increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation . they observed that the committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further and argued against additional adjustments until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the committee s symmetric percent objective over the medium term . in contrast some other participants were more worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further or from the easing in financial conditions that had developed since the committee s policy normalization process was initiated in december . they cautioned that a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation could result in an overshooting of the committee s inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse or that a delay could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind . one participant stressed that the risks both to the committee s inflation objective and to financial stability would require careful monitoring . this participant expressed the view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation would likely strike the appropriate balance between promoting the committee s inflation and full employment objectives and mitigating financial stability concerns.a number of participants also commented that the appropriate pace of normalization of the federal funds rate would depend on how financial conditions evolved and on the implications of those developments for the pace of economic activity . among the considerations mentioned were the extent of current downward pressure on longer term yields arising from the federal reserve s asset holdings and how this pressure would diminish over time as balance sheet normalization proceeded the strength and degree of persistence of other domestic and global factors that had contributed to the easing of financial conditions and elevated asset prices and whether and how much the neutral rate of interest would rise as the economy continued to expand.participants also discussed the appropriate time to implement the plan for reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings that was announced in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans . participants generally agreed that in light of their current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon absent significant adverse developments in the economy or in financial markets . many noted that the program was expected to contribute only modestly to the reduction in policy accommodation . several reiterated that once the program was under way further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments would be centered on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate . al though several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting while accumulating additional information on the economic outlook and developments potentially affecting financial markets.committee policy actionin their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in june indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand.on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy members continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis was expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . members saw the near term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but in light of their concern about the recent slowing in inflation they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . they expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . they also again stated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data . in particular they reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee s symmetric inflation goal . some members stressed the importance of underscoring the committee s commitment to its inflation objective . these members emphasized that in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory consistent with achieving the committee s percent objective over the medium term.members agreed that at this meeting the committee should further clarify the time at which it expected to begin its program for reducing its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner . they updated the postmeeting statement to indicate that while the committee was for the time being maintaining its existing reinvestment policy it intended to begin implementing the balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolved broadly as anticipated . several members observed that in part because of the committee s various communications regarding the change any reaction in financial markets to such a change would likely be limited.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at p.m. effective july the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend holiday or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of . percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of billion per day.the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities . the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions . the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at p.m. information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year . job gains have been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate has declined . household spending and business fixed investment have continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed on balance.consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability . the committee continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis is expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments . the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal . the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . however the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.for the time being the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction . the committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated this program is described in the

federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday september at a.m. and continued on wednesday september at a.m.developments in financial markets and open market operationsthe manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets . nominal treasury yields declined notably over the period driven by weaker than expected data releases\\u00e2 especially the july employment report in early august\\u00e2 and policy communications that were seen as affirming expectations that a reduction in policy restraint would begin at this meeting . the decline in nominal yields over the period was primarily attributable to lower expected real yields but measures of inflation compensation declined as well . broad equity prices finished the period modestly higher while credit spreads had come off the very tight levels seen earlier this year but were still narrow by historical standards . overall risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion.the manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early august . that episode saw some large moves in u.s . and foreign equity indexes equity implied volatilities the dollar\\u00e2 yen exchange rate and treasury yields . these sharp moves appeared to be the result of a rapid unwinding of some speculative trading positions induced by unrelated events\\u00e2 such as the unexpectedly inflation focused communications from the bank of japan boj in late july and the weaker than expected u.s . employment report in early august\\u00e2 and amplified by technical and liquidity factors . all told the unwinding process was contained and market functioning recovered relatively quickly.turning to policy expectations the manager noted that the market implied policy rate path shifted down materially . at the time of the september meeting the modal path for the federal funds rate implied by options prices was consistent with about basis points of cuts through year end compared with around basis points at the time of the july meeting . the average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the options implied modal path likely reflecting investors perception that risks were tilted toward more rather than fewer cuts . in the open market desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants most respondents had a modal expectation of a basis point cut at this meeting though the manager also noted that since the time of the surveys\\u00e2 about a week earlier\\u00e2 the probability of a basis point cut at the september meeting implied by futures prices had increased and exceeded the implied probability of a basis point cut . the median respondent s modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years in line with the options implied modal path and was unchanged thereafter . balance sheet expectations in the surveys were little changed from july . most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term the median dealer s most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the july survey and was roughly stable around current levels.in international developments many central banks in advanced foreign economies afes had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period with the bank of england boe deciding to initiate its rate cutting cycle with a basis point reduction and the european central bank ecb and the bank of canada boc delivering their second and third basis point cut respectively . the market implied expectations for year end policy rates fell over the period for most central banks in afes although by a smaller amount than they did for the federal reserve contributing to a modest decline in the trade weighted u.s . dollar index.the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations . unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period . in secured funding markets rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo were higher than a few months earlier amid large issuance of treasury securities and elevated demand for securities financing but were little changed on net over the period . the manager discussed the interconnections between the repo and federal funds markets underscoring the importance of monitoring a range of indicators to assess reserve conditions and the state of money markets . looking at a range of such indicators the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant.usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility declined about billion over the intermeeting period helped by an increase in the net supply of treasury bills . with net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the september tax date before increasing again the staff assessed that the decline in on rrp usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year . the manager also added that with the concentration of on rrp usage in a small number of fund complexes there was an increased risk that idiosyncratic allocation decisions could have an outsized effect on aggregate on rrp volumes.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp had expanded solidly so far this year . the pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . consumer price inflation was well below its year earlier rate but remained somewhat elevated.consumer price inflation\\u00e2 as measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce \\u00e2 was lower in july than it had been in march which had followed some high month over month changes in the beginning of the year . monthly changes in pce prices since april had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year . on a month basis total pce price inflation was . percent in july and core pce price inflation\\u00e2 which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices\\u00e2 was . percent . in august the month change in the consumer price index cpi was . percent and core cpi inflation was . percent both measures were well below their rates from a year ago . the staff estimated given both the cpi and producer price index data that total pce price inflation would be . percent over the months ending in august and that core pce price inflation would be . percent.recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further but remained solid . over july and august average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were less than their average second quarter pace the unemployment rate edged up to . percent the labor force participation rate ticked up and the employment to population ratio ticked down . the unemployment rate for african americans moved down while the rate for hispanics rose and both rates were above those for asians and for whites . the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment edged down to . in august a bit below its level just before the pandemic . job layoffs as measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low through august . measures of nominal labor compensation continued to decelerate . average hourly earnings for all employees rose . percent over the months ending in august and the four quarter change in business sector compensation per hour was . percent in the second quarter . both measures were well below their pace from a year earlier.real gdp rose solidly on balance over the first half of the year . real private domestic final purchases pdfp \\u00e2 which comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentum\\u00e2 posted a stronger first half increase than gdp and pdfp growth over the first half was only moderately slower than last year . recent indicators for third quarter gdp and pdfp suggested that economic growth was continuing at a solid pace particularly for pce and business investment in equipment and intangibles.after growing at a tepid pace in the second quarter real exports of goods moved down in july led by declines in exports of autos and industrial supplies . by contrast real imports of goods especially of capital goods continued to grow at a robust pace in july.real gdp growth in foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter and recent economic indicators suggested economic growth abroad remained subdued . although services activity and high tech manufacturing had been relatively robust overall manufacturing activity remained weak in part due to restrictive monetary policies . weakness in manufacturing was particularly pronounced in canada germany and mexico . in china indicators of domestic demand remained weak.inflation in economies abroad continued to abate on net though developments were mixed . in the afes excluding japan month headline inflation ticked down but remained above target levels due to still high services inflation . in the emerging market economies inflation moved sideways with some latin american economies still experiencing upward inflation pressures from food prices . the boe cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle while the boc the ecb and the bank of mexico eased policy further in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets . by contrast the boj continued to remove monetary accommodation.staff review of the financial situationthe market implied path for the federal funds rate declined notably over the intermeeting period . similarly options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early than they had just before the july fomc meeting . consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path nominal treasury yields declined significantly on net with the most pronounced decreases at shorter horizons driven by reductions in both inflation compensation and real treasury yields . market based measures of interest rate uncertainty in the near term rose notably reportedly reflecting in part increased concerns among investors about downside risks to economic activity.broad stock price indexes increased on net despite a sizable but temporary drop in early august . yield spreads on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds were little changed on net and remained in the bottom quintile of their respective historical distributions . the one month option implied volatility on the s p index ended the period roughly unchanged on net after a large but temporary spike in early august.overnight secured rates were largely unchanged and conditions in u.s . short term funding markets remained stable . average usage of the on rrp facility declined as net treasury bill issuance increased providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds.market based measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most afes fell notably largely in response to declines in u.s . interest rates . the broad dollar index declined with the dollar depreciating significantly against afe currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the u.s . economy and afes . financial markets were volatile early in the intermeeting period following the weaker than expected u.s . employment report and the policy rate increase by the boj which led to the unwinding of some speculative trading positions . however declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period.in domestic credit markets borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments . rates on year conforming residential mortgages and yields on agency mortgage backed securities mbs declined on net but continued to be elevated . interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels . interest rates for newly originated commercial real estate cre loans on banks books increased . yields on an array of fixed income securities including investment and speculative grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs moved lower generally following decreases in benchmark treasury yields.financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and for large and middle market private corporations and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid . for smaller firms however credit availability remained moderately tight . commercial and industrial loan balances at banks were little changed on net . credit remained generally accessible to most cre borrowers . cre loans at banks continued to decelerate in july and were unchanged in august . non agency cmbs issuance was robust in august while agency cmbs issuance slipped to a bit below its post pandemic average.credit remained available for most consumers though credit growth showed signs of moderating . auto lending continued to slow while balances on credit cards increased moderately in july and august on average . in the residential mortgage market access to credit was little changed overall and continued to be sensitive to borrowers credit risk attributes.credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but kept deteriorating in other sectors . the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable . delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre pandemic levels . credit quality in the cre market deteriorated further with the average delinquency rate for loans in cmbs and the share of nonperforming cre loans at banks both rising further . regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre pandemic lows . though consumer loan delinquency rates remained above pre pandemic levels the pace of increases had slowed . delinquency rates for credit cards rose moderately in the second quarter while they were largely flat for auto loans.staff economic outlookthe staff forecast at the september meeting was for the economy to remain solid with real gdp growth about the same as in the forecast for the july meeting but the unemployment rate a little higher . although real gdp growth in the second quarter was stronger than the staff had expected the forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year was marked down largely in response to recent softer than expected labor market indicators . the real gdp growth forecast for as a whole was little changed though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast . over through real gdp growth was expected to rise about in line with the staff s estimate of potential output growth . the unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from through . all told supply and demand in labor and product markets were forecast to be more balanced and resource utilization less tight than they had been in recent years.the staff s inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting primarily reflecting incoming data along with the projection of a less tight economy . both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be percent.the staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected . the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation . the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run . these projections were based on participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy including their projections of the federal funds rate . the longer run projections represented each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy . the summary of economic projections was released to the public after the meeting.in their discussion of inflation developments participants observed that inflation remained somewhat elevated but almost all participants judged that recent monthly readings had been consistent with inflation returning sustainably to percent . some participants commented that though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services . notably core goods prices had declined in recent months and the rate of increase in core nonhousing services prices had moved down further . many participants remarked that the recent inflation data were consistent with reports received from business contacts who had indicated that their pricing power was limited or diminishing and that consumers were increasingly seeking discounts . many participants also observed that inflation developments in the second and third quarters of suggested that the stronger than anticipated inflation readings in the first quarter had been only a temporary interruption of progress toward percent . participants remarked that even though the rate of increase in housing services prices had slowed these prices were continuing to rise at an elevated rate in contrast to many other core prices.with regard to the outlook for inflation almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation . these included a further modest slowing in real gdp growth in part due to the committee s restrictive monetary policy stance well anchored inflation expectations waning pricing power increases in productivity and a softening in world commodity prices . several participants noted that nominal wage growth was continuing to slow with a few participants citing signs that it was set to decline further . these signs included lower rates of increases in cyclically sensitive wages and data indicating that job switchers were no longer receiving a wage premium over other employees . a couple of participants remarked that with wages being a relatively large portion of business costs in the services sector that sector s disinflation process would be particularly assisted by slower nominal wage growth . in addition several participants observed that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance wage increases were unlikely to be a source of general inflation pressures in the near future . with regard to housing services prices some participants suggested that a more rapid disinflationary trend might emerge fairly soon reflecting the slower pace of rent increases faced by new tenants . participants emphasized that inflation remained somewhat elevated and that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.participants noted that labor market conditions had eased further in recent months and that after being overheated in recent years the labor market was now less tight than it had been just before the pandemic . as evidence participants cited the slowdown in payroll employment growth and the uptick in the unemployment rate in the two employment reports received since the committee s july meeting lower readings on hiring and job vacancies reduced quits and job finding rates and widespread reports from business contacts of less difficulty in hiring workers . some participants highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate had risen notably on net since april . participants noted however that labor market conditions remained solid as layoffs had been limited and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had stayed low . some participants stressed that rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings reducing hours or making use of attrition . a few participants suggested that firms remained reluctant to lay off workers after having difficulty obtaining employees earlier in the post pandemic period . some participants remarked that the recent pace of payroll increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis assuming a constant labor force participation rate . many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging with increased immigration revisions to reported payroll data and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors . several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data . participants agreed that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with the committee s longer run goal of maximum employment.with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to percent . participants indicated that in their baseline economic outlooks which included an appropriate recalibration of the committee s monetary policy stance the labor market would remain solid . participants agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring with some noting that as conditions in the labor market have eased the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration.participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and highlighted resilient consumption spending . a couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans . a couple of participants suggested that the financial strains being experienced by low and moderate income households would likely imply slower consumption growth in coming periods . various participants reported that their business contacts were optimistic about the economic outlook though they were exercising caution in their hiring and investment decisions . participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments including increases in productivity had contributed to the recent solid expansion of economic activity and a few participants discussed possible implications of the introduction of new technology into the workplace . many participants emphasized that they expected that real gdp would grow at roughly its trend rate over the next few years.participants discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook . almost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased . as a result those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the committee s dual mandate goals as being roughly in balance . a couple of participants however did not perceive an increased risk of a significant further weakening in labor market conditions . several participants cited risks of a sharper than expected slowing in consumer spending in response to labor market cooling or to continuing strains on the budgets of low and moderate income households . risks to achieving the committee s price stability goal had diminished significantly since the target range for the federal funds rate was last raised and the vast majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced . a couple of participants specifically noted upside inflation risks associated with geopolitical developments . in addition some participants cited risks that progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective could be stalled by a larger than anticipated easing in financial conditions stronger than expected consumption growth or continued strong increases in housing services prices.in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation had made further progress toward the committee s objective but remained somewhat elevated . almost all participants expressed greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks all participants agreed that it was appropriate to ease the stance of monetary policy . given the significant progress made since the committee first set its target range for the federal funds rate at to percent a substantial majority of participants supported lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent . these participants generally observed that such a recalibration of the stance of monetary policy would begin to bring it into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market . they also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation and would reflect the balance of risks . some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward percent while the labor market continued to cool . however noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low some participants observed that they would have preferred a basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision . several participants noted that a basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved . a few participants also added that a basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization . a few participants remarked that the overall path of policy normalization rather than the specific amount of initial easing at this meeting would be more important in determining the degree of policy restriction . participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings.in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected with inflation moving down sustainably to percent and the economy near maximum employment it would likely be appropriate to move toward a more neutral stance of policy over time . participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants assessments of the appropriate path . those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness . participants generally remarked on the importance of communicating that the committee s monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks and therefore not on a preset course . several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the federal reserve s balance sheet could continue for some time even as the committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate.in discussing risk management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased . some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment . a few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way . several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a stalling or a reversal of the progress on inflation . some participants noted that uncertainties concerning the level of the longer term neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of policy and in their view made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually.committee policy actionsin their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace . job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . members concurred that there had been further progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated . almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent and judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committee s dual mandate.in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . one member voted against that decision preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . members concurred that in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks . members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs . all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook . they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals . members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at p.m. effective september the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary

principal payments from the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month . redeem treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.reinvest the amount of principal payments from the federal reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage\\u00e2 backed securities mbs received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month into treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding.allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons.engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserve s agency mbs transactions . the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at p.m. recent indicators suggest that economic activity has

remains somewhat elevated.the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run . the committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is

McKay, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisDevelopments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) turned first to a discussion of financial developments. Over the intermeeting period, there were significant swings in asset prices, and financial conditions tightened, on net, as market participants assessed incoming information about the economy. In the United States, near-term policy rate expectations shifted markedly toward the end of the period, particularly after the release of the May consumer price index (CPI) report. Ahead of the release of the report, market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be 50 basis point rate increases at both the June and July FOMC meetings. After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well. Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook.Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury securities ended the period significantly higher, primarily reflecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period. Market participants reported that while liquidity conditions in the market for Treasury securities had been affected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall market functioning had held up. Responding to higher interest rates and some concerns about the growth outlook, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period.The manager turned next to a discussion of developments related to foreign central banks. Most major foreign central banks were proceeding on a path of removing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Several\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094had raised their policy rates 50 basis points over the intermeeting period, and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tightening in order to address inflation risks. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced an end to its asset purchase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in July. Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accommodative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve control target. On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies.Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effective federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates. The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the period. Contacts attributed the downward pressure on secured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevated uncertainty about the interest rate path, which had increased demand for short-term investments. In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in overnight private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider further lifting the per-counterparty limit. Over the longer term, ON RRP usage was expected to fall, with the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate.The deputy manager turned next to a discussion of Federal Reserve operations and related topics. In accordance with the directive to the Open Market Desk, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings began in June, under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $17.5 billion for agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under current staff projections, the SOMA portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly $400 billion by the end of 2022. As noted in the recent SOMA annual report and reported in the Board's first-quarter financial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unrealized loss, reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates. Unrealized losses had no implications for Federal Reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached maturity. The staff projected that SOMA net income would decline and potentially turn negative, with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some liabilities, and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Neither unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve's existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would impair the implementation of monetary policy or the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.On other operational matters, the deputy manager noted that, over the intermeeting period, the Desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility (SRF), resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved, to date, as SRF counterparties.By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information available at the time of the June 14\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quarter. The labor market remained very tight, but there were some signs that momentum was slowing. Consumer price inflation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as measured by the 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May.Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the increases were widespread across industries.Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period. Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer-run rate of 2 percent.Production and spending indicators were mixed but generally remained strong. Consumer spending and industrial production posted sizable gains in April. However, retail sales declined in May, data on home sales and single-family housing starts moved down in April, some indicators of manufacturing activity weakened in May, and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary June reading. Supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors (such as general merchandise retailers) but to have deteriorated in others (such as materials for home construction). On balance, the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the second quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter.Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. By contrast, real goods exports grew in both March and April after declining in the previous two months, following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and pharmaceuticals, which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April.Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth. In China, activity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on economic activity. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to have an imprint on foreign activity, with persistent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence, especially in Europe. Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further increases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services. Central banks around the world further tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation.Staff Review of the Financial SituationOver the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher on net. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined considerably, on balance, amid elevated market volatility. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), sovereign yields also increased further, and foreign equity price indexes moved lower. Despite further increases in borrowing costs, financing conditions in domestic credit markets remained generally accommodative. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the outlook for credit quality had begun to deteriorate somewhat.Since the previous FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields increased considerably on net. Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings. However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely being interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. The expected federal funds rate path\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094also increased notably on balance. Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net. The stock price declines were largely associated with mixed corporate earnings news early in the period and increasing concerns about the economic outlook amid global policy tightening. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the VIX\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094increased moderately, on balance, remaining elevated relative to its historical distribution and significantly above average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on investment-grade and, to a greater extent, speculative-grade corporate bonds widened notably, on net, reaching levels comparable with those at the end of 2018. This widening of spreads was associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening. Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the May increase in the Federal Reserve's administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money market rates. Spreads on longer-tenor commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed moderately, with no signs of spillovers beyond the stablecoin market following the collapse of a large algorithmic stablecoin. Indeed, CP outstanding increased slightly over the period. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Secured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meeting, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility increased further.Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeeting period amid investors' concerns about further inflationary pressures and major central banks' policy communications suggesting a firmer stance of policy. Interest rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with increased uncertainty about the path of policy rates. Concerns about the global growth outlook weighed on equity prices, and the broad dollar edged up. Implied equity price volatility remained at elevated levels. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro-area peripheral countries widened further. These moves were partially retraced following an unscheduled meeting of the ECB on June 15, at which the ECB indicated that it would take action to address potential fragmentation risk in euro-area sovereign bond markets. Outflows from emerging market-dedicated funds intensified in early May, especially from local currency bond funds, and credit spreads in emerging market economies widened moderately.In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. Credit remained widely available, particularly to higher-rated firms and consumers with higher credit scores. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, especially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance decelerated and initial public offering volumes remained extremely slow in May, while gross issuance of municipal bonds remained robust.Commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks' balance sheets expanded at a rapid pace in April and May. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Small business loan originations through April were in line with pre-pandemic levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available.Residential mortgage credit remained widely available through May for most borrowers. While refinance volumes continued trending lower in April and May amid higher mortgage rates, outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade, likely reflecting a substitution by homeowners away from cash-out refinances. In consumer credit markets, auto loans outstanding grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, consistent with a rebound in auto sales, but slowed in April and May. Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May.Borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sectors since the previous FOMC meeting. Yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds remained well above pre-pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institutional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both April and May. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting period, in line with the increases in MBS and Treasury yields, reaching their highest levels since 2010. In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward.Despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in April, in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the volume of upgrades. In addition, market indicators of future default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent, as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook.Credit quality of business loans on banks' books remained sound, with C&I and CRE delinquency rates continuing to be low through March. Nonetheless, banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. Delinquency rates on CMBS and small business loans continued to decline, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong.Household credit quality remained solid, with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near historical lows. In addition, mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months. While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account holders with below-prime credit scores inched up from low levels. The sizable increases in credit card purchase volumes through March were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments, thus increasing household borrowing only slightly.Staff Economic OutlookThe projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection. The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year. However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2022 and for 2023. The level of real GDP was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year. Labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight, albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection.With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to stronger-than-expected wage growth and the staff's assessment that the boost to inflation from supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than previously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances were projected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints. Similarly, core inflation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024.The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The staff judged that the ongoing war in Ukraine remained a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse developments associated with China's zero-COVID policy were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad.Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In addition, participants indicated that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks.With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment appeared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. Correspondingly, participants indicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment and price stability. An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Participants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improvement in supply constraints, and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of policy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors.In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that consumption spending had remained robust, in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market. Several participants noted that household spending patterns appeared to be shifting away from goods to services. Several participants indicated that some of their contacts reported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Participants generally expected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales, and a couple of participants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably. Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer sentiment had dropped notably in June, according to the preliminary reading in the Michigan survey.With respect to the business sector, participants observed that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook. In many industries, the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain disruptions. Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and agricultural producers' ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expanding their production capacity. Similarly, a few participants noted that, in other sectors of the economy, their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and financing costs. With supply challenges still widespread, contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant, and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time.Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. These indicators included an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage growth. Additionally, most business contacts had continued to report persistent wage pressures as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, some contacts reported that, because of previous wage hikes, hiring and retention had improved and pressure for additional wage increases appeared to be receding.Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust. Several participants observed that labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level because of the unusually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was unlikely to move up considerably in the near term. A couple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity.While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices. As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appropriate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market. With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to diminish over time, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a gradual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024. In light of the very high level of job vacancies, a number of participants judged that the expected moderation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate.Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, with total PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. They also observed that the 12-month change in the CPI in May came in above expectations. Participants were concerned that the May CPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating, and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persistent than they had previously anticipated. They commented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation, with low- and moderate-income households especially affected. These households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food, energy, and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate-income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, together with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and services. They noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and putting additional upward pressure on inflation. Participants commented on the global nature of inflation pressures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy. Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector. Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submissions, largely in response to higher-than-expected inflation readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints. They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Committee's longer-run objectives by 2024 and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expectations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey. With respect to market-based measures, however, a few participants noted that medium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures were unchanged. While measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants were generally judged to be broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run 2 percent inflation objective, many participants raised the concern that longer-run inflation expectations could be beginning to drift up to levels inconsistent with the 2 percent objective. These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee's objective.In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations. Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices. Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated. In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals recently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy's underlying momentum. Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the downside. Downside risks included the possibility that a further tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China would have larger-than-expected effects on economic growth.In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation was well above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective, and the near-term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meeting. Against this backdrop, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting. One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points. All participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time.In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee's objectives. In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting. Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.Participants noted that, with the federal funds rate expected to be near or above estimates of its longer-run level later this year, the Committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments. They also remarked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Many participants noted that the Committee's credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Participants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected.At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee's legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk management perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected. Many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as warranted. On this matter, participants stressed that appropriate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in restoring price stability.Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-related lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis.Committee Policy ActionIn their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. With the effects of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia already materializing, members considered it appropriate to omit from the June statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the U.S. economy. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, members agreed that the Committee would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent at this meeting.Members judged that, with high and widespread inflation pressures and some measures of longer-term inflation expectations moving up somewhat, it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market conditions, members also agreed to remove the previous statement language that had indicated an expectation that appropriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market.Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 1.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 1.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBSreceived in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month.Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.\\\"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.Table 2.

As described in the box \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cForecast Uncertainty,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Approach,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February),https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1.Return to table2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis.Return to table3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter.Return to tableForecast UncertaintyThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in pastMonetary Policy Reportsand those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.7 to 5.3 percent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 0.6 to 3.4 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second year, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the third year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfan charts\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.Back to

general counsel until the selection of his successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the committee in .developments in financial markets and open market operationsthe manager of the system open market account soma reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets over the period since the june fomc meeting . the intermeeting period was relatively uneventful . bond yields in advanced economies increased moderately in part reflecting evolving market perceptions of prospects for foreign monetary policies . u.s . bond yields rose to a smaller degree and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets decreased . implied volatility in fixed income markets remained low . equity prices rose further with notable advances in indexes for emerging markets.the increase in the fomc s target range for the federal funds rate at the june meeting was reflected in other money market interest rates and the effective federal funds rate was near the middle of the new target range over the intermeeting period except on quarter end . take up at the system s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility averaged about billion . conditions in foreign exchange swap markets were fairly stable and demand at central bank dollar auctions was relatively low . the manager also reported on small value tests of open market operations which are conducted routinely to promote operational readiness.market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed . survey evidence suggested that most market participants now anticipated that the fomc would announce at its september meeting a date for implementation of a change in reinvestment policy although a couple of survey respondents expressed the view that the timing could be affected by developments regarding the federal debt ceiling . the survey results also suggested that while views were somewhat dispersed respondents typically expected effects on bond yields and spreads on mortgage backed securities from the change in reinvestment policy to be modest.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information reviewed for the july meeting showed that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in june and that real gross domestic product gdp likely expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter . the month change in overall consumer prices as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce slowed again in may both total consumer price inflation and core inflation which excludes consumer food and energy prices were running below percent . data from the consumer and producer price indexes for june suggested that both total and core pce price inflation on a month change basis remained at a pace similar to that seen in the previous month . survey\\u00e2 based measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly in june and the average monthly pace of private sector job gains over the first half of the year was essentially the same as last year . the unemployment rate edged up to . percent in june the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics declined slightly but remained above the unemployment rates for asians and for whites . in addition the median length of time that unemployed african americans had been out of work exceeded the comparable figures for whites and for hispanics a pattern that has prevailed for at least the past two decades . the overall labor force participation rate edged up in june and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose a bit . the rate of private sector job openings decreased in may after having risen for a couple of months while the quits rate and the hiring rate both increased . the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through mid\\u00e2 july . average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months ending in june about the same as over the comparable period a year earlier but a little slower than the rate of increase in late .total industrial production rose moderately on balance in may and june as an increase in the output of mines and utilities more than offset a net decline in manufacturing production . automakers assembly schedules indicated that motor vehicle production would edge down again in the third quarter likely reflecting a somewhat elevated level of dealers inventories and a slowing in the pace of vehicle sales last quarter . however broader indicators of manufacturing production such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in factory output over the near term.real pce appeared to have rebounded in the second quarter after increasing only modestly in the first quarter . much of the rebound looked to have been concentrated in spending on energy services and energy goods which was held down by unseasonably warm weather earlier in the year . the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the bureau of economic analysis to construct its estimate of pce declined in june but rose on net in the second quarter . light motor vehicle sales edged down further in june . however recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including continued gains in employment real disposable personal income and households net worth pointed to solid growth in total real pce in the near term . consumer sentiment as measured by the university of michigan surveys of consumers remained upbeat despite having moved down in early july.residential investment seemed to have declined in the second quarter . starts of both new single family homes and multifamily units rose in june but still decreased for the second quarter as a whole . the issuance of building permits for both types of housing was lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter . sales of existing homes decreased on net in may and june and new home sales in may partly reversed the previous month s decline.real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to have increased moderately in the second quarter after a solid gain in the first quarter . nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose again in may and new orders of these goods continued to exceed shipments pointing to further gains in shipments in the near term . in addition indicators of business sentiment remained upbeat . investment in nonresidential structures appeared to have risen at a markedly slower pace in the second quarter than in the first . firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining declined further in may and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector leveled out in recent weeks after increasing steadily for the past year.nominal outlays for defense through june pointed to an increase in real federal government purchases in the second quarter . however real purchases by state and local governments appeared to have declined . payrolls for state and local governments expanded during the second quarter but nominal construction spending by these governments decreased on net in april and may.the nominal u.s . international trade deficit narrowed in may with an increase in exports and a small decline in imports . export growth was led by consumer goods automotive products and services . the import decline was driven by consumer goods and automotive products . the available data suggested that net exports were a slight drag on real gdp growth in the second quarter.total u.s . consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased percent over the months ending in may . core pce price inflation was also percent over that same period . over the months ending in june the consumer price index cpi rose percent while core cpi inflation was percent . the median of inflation expectations over the next to years from the michigan survey edged up both in june and in the preliminary reading for july . other measures of longer\\u00e2 run inflation expectations were generally little changed on balance in recent months although those from the desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants had ticked down recently.incoming data suggested that economic growth continued to firm abroad especially among advanced foreign economies afes . the pickup in advanced economy demand also contributed to relatively strong growth in china and emerging asia but growth in latin america remained relatively weak partly reflecting tight monetary and fiscal policies . despite the stronger momentum of economic activity in the afes headline inflation declined sharply in the second quarter largely reflecting lower retail energy prices and core inflation stayed subdued in many afes . although inflation was also low in most emerging market economies emes it remained elevated in mexico because of rising food inflation and earlier peso depreciation.staff review of the financial situationdomestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period . u.s . equity prices rose longer term treasury yields increased slightly and the dollar depreciated . the committee s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at the june meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and market participants reportedly viewed fomc communications as largely in line with expectations . financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households generally remained supportive of growth in spending.fomc communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as broadly in line with investors expectations that the committee would continue to remove policy accommodation at a gradual pace . market participants generally interpreted the information on reinvestment policy provided in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans as consistent with their expectation that a change to reinvestment policy was likely to occur this year . market participants also took note of the summary in the june minutes of the committee s discussion of the progress toward the committee s percent longer run inflation objective and the extent to which recent softness in price data reflected idiosyncratic factors . overnight index swap rates pointed to little change in the expected path of the federal funds rate on net.yields on intermediate and longer term nominal treasury securities increased slightly over the intermeeting period . although yields fell following the publication of lower than expected cpi data yields were boosted by comments from foreign central bank officials that investors read as pointing to less accommodative monetary policies abroad than previously expected . measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation protected securities ticked up since the june fomc meeting . despite their intermeeting period gains longer term real and nominal treasury yields remained very low by historical standards apparently weighed down by accommodative monetary policies abroad and possibly by declines in the long term neutral real interest rate over recent years.broad u.s . equity price indexes rose . one\\u00e2 month ahead option implied volatility of the s p index the vix remained at historically low levels . spreads of yields on investment and speculative grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over comparable maturity treasury securities narrowed a bit on net.conditions in short term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period . reflecting the fomc s policy action in june yields on a broad set of money market instruments moved about basis points higher . however over much of the period the net increase in rates on shorter dated treasury bills was smaller reportedly reflecting a reduction in treasury bill supply.financing for large nonfinancial firms remained readily available al though debt issuance moderated . gross issuance of corporate bonds stepped down in june from a strong pace in may while issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued to be robust . commercial and industrial lending by banks remained quite weak in the second quarter . responses from the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible and that banks lending standards were little changed in recent months . the most cited reason for the lackluster loan demand was subdued investment spending by nonfinancial businesses but banks also reported that some borrowers had shifted to other sources of external financing or to internally generated funds.financing conditions for commercial real estate cre remained accommodative although the growth of cre loans on banks books slowed somewhat . respondents to the july sloos reported tightening credit standards for these loans . sloos respondents also reported that standards on cre loans were tight relative to their historical range and that on net demand for cre loans weakened in recent months . the pace of issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs through the first half of the year was similar to that seen last year . delinquency rates on loans in cmbs pools originated before the financial crisis continued to increase.financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed and flows of new credit continued at a moderate pace . however growth of mortgage loans on banks books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year . sloos respondents on net reported that standards on most residential mortgage loan categories eased slightly.consumer credit continued to grow on a year over year basis but the expansion of credit card and auto loan balances appeared to slow from the rapid pace that was evident through the end of last year . in the july sloos banks reported having tightened standards and widened spreads for credit card and auto loans on net . standards for the subprime segments of these loan types were particularly tight compared with their historical ranges . reflecting in part continued tightening of lending standards consumer loan growth at banks moderated further in the second quarter however that weakness was partially offset by more robust lending by credit unions.since the june fomc meeting the broad dollar depreciated percent weakening more against afe currencies than against eme currencies . the dollar s depreciation was driven in part by policy communications from the central banks of several afes that market participants viewed as less accommodative than expected as well as by weaker than expected cpi data in the united states . the bank of canada raised its policy rate in july . sovereign yields increased notably in canada germany and the united kingdom . changes in foreign equity indexes were mixed over the intermeeting period european equities edged lower japanese equities were little changed and eme equities increased . european peripheral sovereign bond spreads narrowed over the period reflecting in part positive sentiment related to the outcomes of the french parliamentary election greek debt negotiations and bank resolutions in italy . eme sovereign spreads were little changed on net.the staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability indicating that it continued to judge the vulnerabilities of the u.s financial system as moderate on balance . this overall assessment incorporated the staff s judgment that since the april assessment vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures had edged up from notable to elevated as asset prices remained high or climbed further risk spreads narrowed and expected and actual volatility remained muted in a range of financial markets . however the staff continued to view vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage as well as maturity and liquidity transformation as low and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate.staff economic outlookthe u.s . economic projection prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast . in particular real gdp growth which was modest in the first quarter was still expected to have stepped up to a solid pace in the second quarter and to maintain roughly the same rate of increase in the second half of the year . in this projection the staff scaled back its assumptions regarding the magnitude and duration of fiscal policy expansion in the coming years . however the effect of this change on the projection for real gdp over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and for longer term interest rates . thus as in the june projection the staff projected that real gdp would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in through . the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate over this period.the staff s forecast for consumer price inflation as measured by the change in the pce price index was revised down slightly for in response to weaker than expected incoming data for inflation . as a result inflation this year was expected to be similar in magnitude to last year with an upturn in the prices for food and non energy imports offset by a slower increase in core pce prices and weaker energy prices . beyond the forecast was little revised from the previous projection as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory . the staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the committee s longer run objective in and at percent in .the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past years . on the one hand many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than late last year on the other hand uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated . the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced . the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced . downside risks included the possibilities that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down that the dollar could appreciate substantially or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected . these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined on net over the same period . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis both overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent overall with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market were little changed on balance since the june fomc meeting . participants continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . in light of continued low recent readings on inflation participants expected that inflation on a month basis would remain somewhat below percent in the near term . however most participants judged that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term.data received over the intermeeting period reinforced earlier indications that real gdp growth had turned up after having been slow in the first quarter of this year . as anticipated growth in household spending appeared to have been stronger in the second quarter after its first quarter weakness . reports from district contacts on consumer spending were generally positive . however sales of motor vehicles had softened and automakers were reportedly adjusting production and assessing whether the underlying demand for automobiles had declined . participants noted that the fundamentals underpinning consumption growth including increases in payrolls remained solid . however the weakness in retail sales in june offered a note of caution.reports from district contacts on both manufacturing and services were also generally consistent with moderate growth in economic activity overall . construction sector contacts were generally upbeat . reports on the energy sector indicated that activity was continuing to expand albeit more slowly than previously survey evidence suggested that oil drilling remained profitable in some locations at current oil prices . the agricultural sector remained weak and some regions were experiencing drought conditions . a couple of participants had received indications from contacts that business investment spending in their districts might strengthen.nevertheless several participants noted that uncertainty about the course of federal government policy including in the areas of fiscal policy trade and health care was tending to weigh down firms spending and hiring plans . in addition a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected . it was also observed that the budgets of some state and local governments were under strain limiting growth in their expenditures . in contrast the prospects for u.s . exports had been boosted by a brighter international economic outlook.participants noted that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period . the unemployment rate rose slightly to . percent in june but remained low by historical standards . payroll gains picked up substantially in june . in addition the employment to population ratio increased . participants observed that the unemployment rate was likely close to or below its longer run normal rate and could decline further if as expected growth in output remained somewhat in excess of the potential growth rate . a few participants expressed concerns about the possibility of substantially overshooting full employment with one citing past difficulties in achieving a soft landing . district contacts confirmed tightness in the labor market but relayed little evidence of wage pressures although some firms were reportedly attempting to attract workers with a variety of nonwage benefits . the absence of sizable wage pressures also seemed to be confirmed by most aggregate wage measures . however a few participants suggested that in a tight labor market measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of less experienced workers at lower wages than those of established workers . in addition a number of participants suggested that the rate of increase in nominal wages was not low in relation to the rate of productivity growth and the modest rate of inflation.participants discussed the softness in inflation in recent months . many participants noted that much of the recent decline in inflation had probably reflected idiosyncratic factors . nonetheless pce price inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis would likely continue to be held down over the second half of the year by the effects of those factors and the monthly readings might be depressed by possible residual seasonality in measured pce inflation . still most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . many participants however saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below percent for longer than they currently expected and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside . participants agreed that a fall in longer term inflation expectations would be undesirable but they differed in their assessments of whether inflation expectations were well anchored . one participant pointed to the stability of a number of measures of inflation expectations in recent months but a few others suggested that continuing low inflation expectations may have been a factor putting downward pressure on inflation or that inflation expectations might need to be bolstered in order to ensure their consistency with the committee s longer term inflation objective.a number of participants noted that much of the analysis of inflation used in policymaking rested on a framework in which for a given rate of expected inflation the degree of upward pressures on prices and wages rose as aggregate demand for goods and services and employment of resources increased above long run sustainable levels . a few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation . however most participants thought that the framework remained valid notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tightening labor market and real gdp growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate . participants discussed possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment . these included a diminished responsiveness of prices to resource pressures a lower natural rate of unemployment the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment lags in the reaction of nominal wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening and restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models spurred by advances in technology . a couple of participants argued that the response of inflation to resource utilization could become stronger if output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels although other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little empirical support.in assessing recent developments in financial market conditions participants referred to the continued low level of longer term interest rates in particular those on u.s treasury securities . the level of such yields appeared to reflect both low expected future short term interest rates and depressed term premiums . asset purchases by foreign central banks and the federal reserve s securities holdings were also likely contributing to currently low term premiums although the exact size of these contributions was uncertain . a number of participants pointed to potential concerns about low longer term interest rates including the possibility that inflation expectations were too low that yields could rise abruptly or that low yields were inducing investors to take on excessive risk in a search for higher returns.several participants noted that the further increases in equity prices together with continued low longer term interest rates had led to an easing of financial conditions . however different assessments were expressed about the implications of this development for the outlook for aggregate demand and consequently appropriate monetary policy . according to one view the easing of financial conditions meant that the economic effects of the committee s actions in gradually removing policy accommodation had been largely offset by other factors influencing financial markets and that a tighter monetary policy than otherwise was warranted . according to another view recent rises in equity prices might be part of a broad based adjustment of asset prices to changes in longer term financial conditions importantly including a lower neutral real interest rate and therefore the recent equity price increases might not provide much additional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and services.participants also considered equity valuations in their discussion of financial stability . a couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations in addition as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability . several participants observed that the banking system was well capitalized and had ample liquidity reducing the risk of financial instability . it was noted that financial stability assessments were based on current capital levels within the banking sector and that such assessments would likely be adjusted should these measures of loss absorbing capacity change . participants underscored the need to monitor financial institutions for shifts in behavior such as an erosion of lending standards or increased reliance on unstable sources of funding that could lead to subsequent problems . in addition participants judged that it was important to look for signs that either declining market volatility or heavy concentration by investors in particular assets might create financial imbalances . a couple of participants expressed concern that smaller banks could be assuming significant risks in efforts to expand their cre lending . furthermore a couple of participants saw as possible sources of financial instability the pace of increase in real estate prices in the multifamily segment and the pattern of the lending and borrowing activities of certain government sponsored enterprises.participants agreed that the regulatory and supervisory tools developed since the financial crisis had played an important role in fostering financial stability . changes in regulation had likely helped in making the banking system more resilient to major shocks in promoting more prudent balance sheet management strategies on the part of nonbank financial institutions and in reducing the degree to which variations in lending to the private sector intensify cycles in output and in asset prices . participants agreed that it would not be desirable for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a reemergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.in their discussion of monetary policy participants reaffirmed their view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation was likely to remain appropriate to promote the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . participants commented on a number of factors that would influence their ongoing assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate . most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed from their earlier projections and continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . however some participants expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation which had occurred even as resource utilization had tightened and noted their increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation . they observed that the committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further and argued against additional adjustments until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the committee s symmetric percent objective over the medium term . in contrast some other participants were more worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further or from the easing in financial conditions that had developed since the committee s policy normalization process was initiated in december . they cautioned that a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation could result in an overshooting of the committee s inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse or that a delay could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind . one participant stressed that the risks both to the committee s inflation objective and to financial stability would require careful monitoring . this participant expressed the view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation would likely strike the appropriate balance between promoting the committee s inflation and full employment objectives and mitigating financial stability concerns.a number of participants also commented that the appropriate pace of normalization of the federal funds rate would depend on how financial conditions evolved and on the implications of those developments for the pace of economic activity . among the considerations mentioned were the extent of current downward pressure on longer term yields arising from the federal reserve s asset holdings and how this pressure would diminish over time as balance sheet normalization proceeded the strength and degree of persistence of other domestic and global factors that had contributed to the easing of financial conditions and elevated asset prices and whether and how much the neutral rate of interest would rise as the economy continued to expand.participants also discussed the appropriate time to implement the plan for reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings that was announced in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans . participants generally agreed that in light of their current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon absent significant adverse developments in the economy or in financial markets . many noted that the program was expected to contribute only modestly to the reduction in policy accommodation . several reiterated that once the program was under way further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments would be centered on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate . al though several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting while accumulating additional information on the economic outlook and developments potentially affecting financial markets.committee policy actionin their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in june indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand.on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy members continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis was expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . members saw the near term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but in light of their concern about the recent slowing in inflation they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . they expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . they also again stated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data . in particular they reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee s symmetric inflation goal . some members stressed the importance of underscoring the committee s commitment to its inflation objective . these members emphasized that in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory consistent with achieving the committee s percent objective over the medium term.members agreed that at this meeting the committee should further clarify the time at which it expected to begin its program for reducing its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner . they updated the postmeeting statement to indicate that while the committee was for the time being maintaining its existing reinvestment policy it intended to begin implementing the balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolved broadly as anticipated . several members observed that in part because of the committee s various communications regarding the change any reaction in financial markets to such a change would likely be limited.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at p.m. effective july the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend holiday or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of . percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of billion per day.the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities . the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions . the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at p.m. information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year . job gains have been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate has declined . household spending and business fixed investment have continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed on balance.consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability . the committee continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis is expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments . the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal . the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . however the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.for the time being the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction . the committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated this program is described in the

federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday september at a.m. and continued on wednesday september at a.m.developments in financial markets and open market operationsthe manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets . nominal treasury yields declined notably over the period driven by weaker than expected data releases\\u00e2 especially the july employment report in early august\\u00e2 and policy communications that were seen as affirming expectations that a reduction in policy restraint would begin at this meeting . the decline in nominal yields over the period was primarily attributable to lower expected real yields but measures of inflation compensation declined as well . broad equity prices finished the period modestly higher while credit spreads had come off the very tight levels seen earlier this year but were still narrow by historical standards . overall risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion.the manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early august . that episode saw some large moves in u.s . and foreign equity indexes equity implied volatilities the dollar\\u00e2 yen exchange rate and treasury yields . these sharp moves appeared to be the result of a rapid unwinding of some speculative trading positions induced by unrelated events\\u00e2 such as the unexpectedly inflation focused communications from the bank of japan boj in late july and the weaker than expected u.s . employment report in early august\\u00e2 and amplified by technical and liquidity factors . all told the unwinding process was contained and market functioning recovered relatively quickly.turning to policy expectations the manager noted that the market implied policy rate path shifted down materially . at the time of the september meeting the modal path for the federal funds rate implied by options prices was consistent with about basis points of cuts through year end compared with around basis points at the time of the july meeting . the average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the options implied modal path likely reflecting investors perception that risks were tilted toward more rather than fewer cuts . in the open market desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants most respondents had a modal expectation of a basis point cut at this meeting though the manager also noted that since the time of the surveys\\u00e2 about a week earlier\\u00e2 the probability of a basis point cut at the september meeting implied by futures prices had increased and exceeded the implied probability of a basis point cut . the median respondent s modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years in line with the options implied modal path and was unchanged thereafter . balance sheet expectations in the surveys were little changed from july . most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term the median dealer s most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the july survey and was roughly stable around current levels.in international developments many central banks in advanced foreign economies afes had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period with the bank of england boe deciding to initiate its rate cutting cycle with a basis point reduction and the european central bank ecb and the bank of canada boc delivering their second and third basis point cut respectively . the market implied expectations for year end policy rates fell over the period for most central banks in afes although by a smaller amount than they did for the federal reserve contributing to a modest decline in the trade weighted u.s . dollar index.the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations . unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period . in secured funding markets rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo were higher than a few months earlier amid large issuance of treasury securities and elevated demand for securities financing but were little changed on net over the period . the manager discussed the interconnections between the repo and federal funds markets underscoring the importance of monitoring a range of indicators to assess reserve conditions and the state of money markets . looking at a range of such indicators the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant.usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility declined about billion over the intermeeting period helped by an increase in the net supply of treasury bills . with net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the september tax date before increasing again the staff assessed that the decline in on rrp usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year . the manager also added that with the concentration of on rrp usage in a small number of fund complexes there was an increased risk that idiosyncratic allocation decisions could have an outsized effect on aggregate on rrp volumes.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp had expanded solidly so far this year . the pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . consumer price inflation was well below its year earlier rate but remained somewhat elevated.consumer price inflation\\u00e2 as measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce \\u00e2 was lower in july than it had been in march which had followed some high month over month changes in the beginning of the year . monthly changes in pce prices since april had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year . on a month basis total pce price inflation was . percent in july and core pce price inflation\\u00e2 which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices\\u00e2 was . percent . in august the month change in the consumer price index cpi was . percent and core cpi inflation was . percent both measures were well below their rates from a year ago . the staff estimated given both the cpi and producer price index data that total pce price inflation would be . percent over the months ending in august and that core pce price inflation would be . percent.recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further but remained solid . over july and august average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were less than their average second quarter pace the unemployment rate edged up to . percent the labor force participation rate ticked up and the employment to population ratio ticked down . the unemployment rate for african americans moved down while the rate for hispanics rose and both rates were above those for asians and for whites . the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment edged down to . in august a bit below its level just before the pandemic . job layoffs as measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low through august . measures of nominal labor compensation continued to decelerate . average hourly earnings for all employees rose . percent over the months ending in august and the four quarter change in business sector compensation per hour was . percent in the second quarter . both measures were well below their pace from a year earlier.real gdp rose solidly on balance over the first half of the year . real private domestic final purchases pdfp \\u00e2 which comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentum\\u00e2 posted a stronger first half increase than gdp and pdfp growth over the first half was only moderately slower than last year . recent indicators for third quarter gdp and pdfp suggested that economic growth was continuing at a solid pace particularly for pce and business investment in equipment and intangibles.after growing at a tepid pace in the second quarter real exports of goods moved down in july led by declines in exports of autos and industrial supplies . by contrast real imports of goods especially of capital goods continued to grow at a robust pace in july.real gdp growth in foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter and recent economic indicators suggested economic growth abroad remained subdued . although services activity and high tech manufacturing had been relatively robust overall manufacturing activity remained weak in part due to restrictive monetary policies . weakness in manufacturing was particularly pronounced in canada germany and mexico . in china indicators of domestic demand remained weak.inflation in economies abroad continued to abate on net though developments were mixed . in the afes excluding japan month headline inflation ticked down but remained above target levels due to still high services inflation . in the emerging market economies inflation moved sideways with some latin american economies still experiencing upward inflation pressures from food prices . the boe cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle while the boc the ecb and the bank of mexico eased policy further in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets . by contrast the boj continued to remove monetary accommodation.staff review of the financial situationthe market implied path for the federal funds rate declined notably over the intermeeting period . similarly options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early than they had just before the july fomc meeting . consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path nominal treasury yields declined significantly on net with the most pronounced decreases at shorter horizons driven by reductions in both inflation compensation and real treasury yields . market based measures of interest rate uncertainty in the near term rose notably reportedly reflecting in part increased concerns among investors about downside risks to economic activity.broad stock price indexes increased on net despite a sizable but temporary drop in early august . yield spreads on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds were little changed on net and remained in the bottom quintile of their respective historical distributions . the one month option implied volatility on the s p index ended the period roughly unchanged on net after a large but temporary spike in early august.overnight secured rates were largely unchanged and conditions in u.s . short term funding markets remained stable . average usage of the on rrp facility declined as net treasury bill issuance increased providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds.market based measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most afes fell notably largely in response to declines in u.s . interest rates . the broad dollar index declined with the dollar depreciating significantly against afe currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the u.s . economy and afes . financial markets were volatile early in the intermeeting period following the weaker than expected u.s . employment report and the policy rate increase by the boj which led to the unwinding of some speculative trading positions . however declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period.in domestic credit markets borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments . rates on year conforming residential mortgages and yields on agency mortgage backed securities mbs declined on net but continued to be elevated . interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels . interest rates for newly originated commercial real estate cre loans on banks books increased . yields on an array of fixed income securities including investment and speculative grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs moved lower generally following decreases in benchmark treasury yields.financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and for large and middle market private corporations and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid . for smaller firms however credit availability remained moderately tight . commercial and industrial loan balances at banks were little changed on net . credit remained generally accessible to most cre borrowers . cre loans at banks continued to decelerate in july and were unchanged in august . non agency cmbs issuance was robust in august while agency cmbs issuance slipped to a bit below its post pandemic average.credit remained available for most consumers though credit growth showed signs of moderating . auto lending continued to slow while balances on credit cards increased moderately in july and august on average . in the residential mortgage market access to credit was little changed overall and continued to be sensitive to borrowers credit risk attributes.credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but kept deteriorating in other sectors . the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable . delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre pandemic levels . credit quality in the cre market deteriorated further with the average delinquency rate for loans in cmbs and the share of nonperforming cre loans at banks both rising further . regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre pandemic lows . though consumer loan delinquency rates remained above pre pandemic levels the pace of increases had slowed . delinquency rates for credit cards rose moderately in the second quarter while they were largely flat for auto loans.staff economic outlookthe staff forecast at the september meeting was for the economy to remain solid with real gdp growth about the same as in the forecast for the july meeting but the unemployment rate a little higher . although real gdp growth in the second quarter was stronger than the staff had expected the forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year was marked down largely in response to recent softer than expected labor market indicators . the real gdp growth forecast for as a whole was little changed though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast . over through real gdp growth was expected to rise about in line with the staff s estimate of potential output growth . the unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from through . all told supply and demand in labor and product markets were forecast to be more balanced and resource utilization less tight than they had been in recent years.the staff s inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting primarily reflecting incoming data along with the projection of a less tight economy . both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be percent.the staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected . the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation . the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run . these projections were based on participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy including their projections of the federal funds rate . the longer run projections represented each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy . the summary of economic projections was released to the public after the meeting.in their discussion of inflation developments participants observed that inflation remained somewhat elevated but almost all participants judged that recent monthly readings had been consistent with inflation returning sustainably to percent . some participants commented that though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services . notably core goods prices had declined in recent months and the rate of increase in core nonhousing services prices had moved down further . many participants remarked that the recent inflation data were consistent with reports received from business contacts who had indicated that their pricing power was limited or diminishing and that consumers were increasingly seeking discounts . many participants also observed that inflation developments in the second and third quarters of suggested that the stronger than anticipated inflation readings in the first quarter had been only a temporary interruption of progress toward percent . participants remarked that even though the rate of increase in housing services prices had slowed these prices were continuing to rise at an elevated rate in contrast to many other core prices.with regard to the outlook for inflation almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation . these included a further modest slowing in real gdp growth in part due to the committee s restrictive monetary policy stance well anchored inflation expectations waning pricing power increases in productivity and a softening in world commodity prices . several participants noted that nominal wage growth was continuing to slow with a few participants citing signs that it was set to decline further . these signs included lower rates of increases in cyclically sensitive wages and data indicating that job switchers were no longer receiving a wage premium over other employees . a couple of participants remarked that with wages being a relatively large portion of business costs in the services sector that sector s disinflation process would be particularly assisted by slower nominal wage growth . in addition several participants observed that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance wage increases were unlikely to be a source of general inflation pressures in the near future . with regard to housing services prices some participants suggested that a more rapid disinflationary trend might emerge fairly soon reflecting the slower pace of rent increases faced by new tenants . participants emphasized that inflation remained somewhat elevated and that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.participants noted that labor market conditions had eased further in recent months and that after being overheated in recent years the labor market was now less tight than it had been just before the pandemic . as evidence participants cited the slowdown in payroll employment growth and the uptick in the unemployment rate in the two employment reports received since the committee s july meeting lower readings on hiring and job vacancies reduced quits and job finding rates and widespread reports from business contacts of less difficulty in hiring workers . some participants highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate had risen notably on net since april . participants noted however that labor market conditions remained solid as layoffs had been limited and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had stayed low . some participants stressed that rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings reducing hours or making use of attrition . a few participants suggested that firms remained reluctant to lay off workers after having difficulty obtaining employees earlier in the post pandemic period . some participants remarked that the recent pace of payroll increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis assuming a constant labor force participation rate . many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging with increased immigration revisions to reported payroll data and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors . several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data . participants agreed that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with the committee s longer run goal of maximum employment.with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to percent . participants indicated that in their baseline economic outlooks which included an appropriate recalibration of the committee s monetary policy stance the labor market would remain solid . participants agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring with some noting that as conditions in the labor market have eased the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration.participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and highlighted resilient consumption spending . a couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans . a couple of participants suggested that the financial strains being experienced by low and moderate income households would likely imply slower consumption growth in coming periods . various participants reported that their business contacts were optimistic about the economic outlook though they were exercising caution in their hiring and investment decisions . participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments including increases in productivity had contributed to the recent solid expansion of economic activity and a few participants discussed possible implications of the introduction of new technology into the workplace . many participants emphasized that they expected that real gdp would grow at roughly its trend rate over the next few years.participants discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook . almost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased . as a result those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the committee s dual mandate goals as being roughly in balance . a couple of participants however did not perceive an increased risk of a significant further weakening in labor market conditions . several participants cited risks of a sharper than expected slowing in consumer spending in response to labor market cooling or to continuing strains on the budgets of low and moderate income households . risks to achieving the committee s price stability goal had diminished significantly since the target range for the federal funds rate was last raised and the vast majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced . a couple of participants specifically noted upside inflation risks associated with geopolitical developments . in addition some participants cited risks that progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective could be stalled by a larger than anticipated easing in financial conditions stronger than expected consumption growth or continued strong increases in housing services prices.in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation had made further progress toward the committee s objective but remained somewhat elevated . almost all participants expressed greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks all participants agreed that it was appropriate to ease the stance of monetary policy . given the significant progress made since the committee first set its target range for the federal funds rate at to percent a substantial majority of participants supported lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent . these participants generally observed that such a recalibration of the stance of monetary policy would begin to bring it into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market . they also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation and would reflect the balance of risks . some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward percent while the labor market continued to cool . however noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low some participants observed that they would have preferred a basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision . several participants noted that a basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved . a few participants also added that a basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization . a few participants remarked that the overall path of policy normalization rather than the specific amount of initial easing at this meeting would be more important in determining the degree of policy restriction . participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings.in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected with inflation moving down sustainably to percent and the economy near maximum employment it would likely be appropriate to move toward a more neutral stance of policy over time . participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants assessments of the appropriate path . those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness . participants generally remarked on the importance of communicating that the committee s monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks and therefore not on a preset course . several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the federal reserve s balance sheet could continue for some time even as the committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate.in discussing risk management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased . some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment . a few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way . several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a stalling or a reversal of the progress on inflation . some participants noted that uncertainties concerning the level of the longer term neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of policy and in their view made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually.committee policy actionsin their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace . job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . members concurred that there had been further progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated . almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent and judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committee s dual mandate.in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . one member voted against that decision preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . members concurred that in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks . members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs . all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook . they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals . members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account

McKay, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisDevelopments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) turned first to a discussion of financial developments. Over the intermeeting period, there were significant swings in asset prices, and financial conditions tightened, on net, as market participants assessed incoming information about the economy. In the United States, near-term policy rate expectations shifted markedly toward the end of the period, particularly after the release of the May consumer price index (CPI) report. Ahead of the release of the report, market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be 50 basis point rate increases at both the June and July FOMC meetings. After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well. Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook.Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury securities ended the period significantly higher, primarily reflecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period. Market participants reported that while liquidity conditions in the market for Treasury securities had been affected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall market functioning had held up. Responding to higher interest rates and some concerns about the growth outlook, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period.The manager turned next to a discussion of developments related to foreign central banks. Most major foreign central banks were proceeding on a path of removing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Several\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094had raised their policy rates 50 basis points over the intermeeting period, and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tightening in order to address inflation risks. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced an end to its asset purchase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in July. Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accommodative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve control target. On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies.Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effective federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates. The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the period. Contacts attributed the downward pressure on secured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevated uncertainty about the interest rate path, which had increased demand for short-term investments. In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in overnight private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider further lifting the per-counterparty limit. Over the longer term, ON RRP usage was expected to fall, with the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate.The deputy manager turned next to a discussion of Federal Reserve operations and related topics. In accordance with the directive to the Open Market Desk, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings began in June, under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $17.5 billion for agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under current staff projections, the SOMA portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly $400 billion by the end of 2022. As noted in the recent SOMA annual report and reported in the Board's first-quarter financial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unrealized loss, reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates. Unrealized losses had no implications for Federal Reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached maturity. The staff projected that SOMA net income would decline and potentially turn negative, with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some liabilities, and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Neither unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve's existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would impair the implementation of monetary policy or the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.On other operational matters, the deputy manager noted that, over the intermeeting period, the Desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility (SRF), resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved, to date, as SRF counterparties.By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information available at the time of the June 14\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quarter. The labor market remained very tight, but there were some signs that momentum was slowing. Consumer price inflation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as measured by the 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May.Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the increases were widespread across industries.Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period. Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer-run rate of 2 percent.Production and spending indicators were mixed but generally remained strong. Consumer spending and industrial production posted sizable gains in April. However, retail sales declined in May, data on home sales and single-family housing starts moved down in April, some indicators of manufacturing activity weakened in May, and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary June reading. Supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors (such as general merchandise retailers) but to have deteriorated in others (such as materials for home construction). On balance, the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the second quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter.Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. By contrast, real goods exports grew in both March and April after declining in the previous two months, following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and pharmaceuticals, which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April.Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth. In China, activity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on economic activity. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to have an imprint on foreign activity, with persistent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence, especially in Europe. Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further increases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services. Central banks around the world further tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation.Staff Review of the Financial SituationOver the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher on net. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined considerably, on balance, amid elevated market volatility. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), sovereign yields also increased further, and foreign equity price indexes moved lower. Despite further increases in borrowing costs, financing conditions in domestic credit markets remained generally accommodative. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the outlook for credit quality had begun to deteriorate somewhat.Since the previous FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields increased considerably on net. Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings. However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely being interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. The expected federal funds rate path\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094also increased notably on balance. Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net. The stock price declines were largely associated with mixed corporate earnings news early in the period and increasing concerns about the economic outlook amid global policy tightening. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the VIX\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094increased moderately, on balance, remaining elevated relative to its historical distribution and significantly above average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on investment-grade and, to a greater extent, speculative-grade corporate bonds widened notably, on net, reaching levels comparable with those at the end of 2018. This widening of spreads was associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening. Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the May increase in the Federal Reserve's administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money market rates. Spreads on longer-tenor commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed moderately, with no signs of spillovers beyond the stablecoin market following the collapse of a large algorithmic stablecoin. Indeed, CP outstanding increased slightly over the period. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Secured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meeting, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility increased further.Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeeting period amid investors' concerns about further inflationary pressures and major central banks' policy communications suggesting a firmer stance of policy. Interest rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with increased uncertainty about the path of policy rates. Concerns about the global growth outlook weighed on equity prices, and the broad dollar edged up. Implied equity price volatility remained at elevated levels. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro-area peripheral countries widened further. These moves were partially retraced following an unscheduled meeting of the ECB on June 15, at which the ECB indicated that it would take action to address potential fragmentation risk in euro-area sovereign bond markets. Outflows from emerging market-dedicated funds intensified in early May, especially from local currency bond funds, and credit spreads in emerging market economies widened moderately.In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. Credit remained widely available, particularly to higher-rated firms and consumers with higher credit scores. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, especially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance decelerated and initial public offering volumes remained extremely slow in May, while gross issuance of municipal bonds remained robust.Commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks' balance sheets expanded at a rapid pace in April and May. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Small business loan originations through April were in line with pre-pandemic levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available.Residential mortgage credit remained widely available through May for most borrowers. While refinance volumes continued trending lower in April and May amid higher mortgage rates, outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade, likely reflecting a substitution by homeowners away from cash-out refinances. In consumer credit markets, auto loans outstanding grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, consistent with a rebound in auto sales, but slowed in April and May. Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May.Borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sectors since the previous FOMC meeting. Yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds remained well above pre-pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institutional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both April and May. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting period, in line with the increases in MBS and Treasury yields, reaching their highest levels since 2010. In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward.Despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in April, in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the volume of upgrades. In addition, market indicators of future default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent, as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook.Credit quality of business loans on banks' books remained sound, with C&I and CRE delinquency rates continuing to be low through March. Nonetheless, banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. Delinquency rates on CMBS and small business loans continued to decline, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong.Household credit quality remained solid, with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near historical lows. In addition, mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months. While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account holders with below-prime credit scores inched up from low levels. The sizable increases in credit card purchase volumes through March were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments, thus increasing household borrowing only slightly.Staff Economic OutlookThe projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection. The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year. However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2022 and for 2023. The level of real GDP was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year. Labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight, albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection.With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to stronger-than-expected wage growth and the staff's assessment that the boost to inflation from supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than previously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances were projected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints. Similarly, core inflation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024.The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The staff judged that the ongoing war in Ukraine remained a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse developments associated with China's zero-COVID policy were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad.Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In addition, participants indicated that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks.With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment appeared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. Correspondingly, participants indicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment and price stability. An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Participants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improvement in supply constraints, and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of policy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors.In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that consumption spending had remained robust, in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market. Several participants noted that household spending patterns appeared to be shifting away from goods to services. Several participants indicated that some of their contacts reported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Participants generally expected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales, and a couple of participants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably. Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer sentiment had dropped notably in June, according to the preliminary reading in the Michigan survey.With respect to the business sector, participants observed that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook. In many industries, the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain disruptions. Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and agricultural producers' ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expanding their production capacity. Similarly, a few participants noted that, in other sectors of the economy, their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and financing costs. With supply challenges still widespread, contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant, and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time.Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. These indicators included an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage growth. Additionally, most business contacts had continued to report persistent wage pressures as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, some contacts reported that, because of previous wage hikes, hiring and retention had improved and pressure for additional wage increases appeared to be receding.Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust. Several participants observed that labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level because of the unusually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was unlikely to move up considerably in the near term. A couple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity.While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices. As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appropriate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market. With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to diminish over time, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a gradual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024. In light of the very high level of job vacancies, a number of participants judged that the expected moderation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate.Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, with total PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. They also observed that the 12-month change in the CPI in May came in above expectations. Participants were concerned that the May CPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating, and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persistent than they had previously anticipated. They commented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation, with low- and moderate-income households especially affected. These households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food, energy, and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate-income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, together with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and services. They noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and putting additional upward pressure on inflation. Participants commented on the global nature of inflation pressures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy. Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector. Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submissions, largely in response to higher-than-expected inflation readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints. They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Committee's longer-run objectives by 2024 and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expectations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey. With respect to market-based measures, however, a few participants noted that medium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures were unchanged. While measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants were generally judged to be broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run 2 percent inflation objective, many participants raised the concern that longer-run inflation expectations could be beginning to drift up to levels inconsistent with the 2 percent objective. These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee's objective.In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations. Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices. Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated. In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals recently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy's underlying momentum. Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the downside. Downside risks included the possibility that a further tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China would have larger-than-expected effects on economic growth.In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation was well above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective, and the near-term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meeting. Against this backdrop, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting. One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points. All participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time.In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee's objectives. In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting. Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.Participants noted that, with the federal funds rate expected to be near or above estimates of its longer-run level later this year, the Committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments. They also remarked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Many participants noted that the Committee's credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Participants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected.At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee's legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk management perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected. Many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as warranted. On this matter, participants stressed that appropriate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in restoring price stability.Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-related lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis.Committee Policy ActionIn their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. With the effects of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia already materializing, members considered it appropriate to omit from the June statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the U.S. economy. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, members agreed that the Committee would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent at this meeting.Members judged that, with high and widespread inflation pressures and some measures of longer-term inflation expectations moving up somewhat, it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market conditions, members also agreed to remove the previous statement language that had indicated an expectation that appropriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market.Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 1.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 1.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBSreceived in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month.Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.\\\"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.Table 2.

As described in the box \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cForecast Uncertainty,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Approach,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February),https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1.Return to table2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis.Return to table3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter.Return to tableForecast UncertaintyThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in pastMonetary Policy Reportsand those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.7 to 5.3 percent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 0.6 to 3.4 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second year, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the third year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfan charts\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.Back to

general counsel until the selection of his successor at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the committee in .developments in financial markets and open market operationsthe manager of the system open market account soma reported on developments in domestic and foreign financial markets over the period since the june fomc meeting . the intermeeting period was relatively uneventful . bond yields in advanced economies increased moderately in part reflecting evolving market perceptions of prospects for foreign monetary policies . u.s . bond yields rose to a smaller degree and the value of the dollar on foreign exchange markets decreased . implied volatility in fixed income markets remained low . equity prices rose further with notable advances in indexes for emerging markets.the increase in the fomc s target range for the federal funds rate at the june meeting was reflected in other money market interest rates and the effective federal funds rate was near the middle of the new target range over the intermeeting period except on quarter end . take up at the system s overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility averaged about billion . conditions in foreign exchange swap markets were fairly stable and demand at central bank dollar auctions was relatively low . the manager also reported on small value tests of open market operations which are conducted routinely to promote operational readiness.market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed . survey evidence suggested that most market participants now anticipated that the fomc would announce at its september meeting a date for implementation of a change in reinvestment policy although a couple of survey respondents expressed the view that the timing could be affected by developments regarding the federal debt ceiling . the survey results also suggested that while views were somewhat dispersed respondents typically expected effects on bond yields and spreads on mortgage backed securities from the change in reinvestment policy to be modest.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information reviewed for the july meeting showed that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in june and that real gross domestic product gdp likely expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter . the month change in overall consumer prices as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce slowed again in may both total consumer price inflation and core inflation which excludes consumer food and energy prices were running below percent . data from the consumer and producer price indexes for june suggested that both total and core pce price inflation on a month change basis remained at a pace similar to that seen in the previous month . survey\\u00e2 based measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly in june and the average monthly pace of private sector job gains over the first half of the year was essentially the same as last year . the unemployment rate edged up to . percent in june the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics declined slightly but remained above the unemployment rates for asians and for whites . in addition the median length of time that unemployed african americans had been out of work exceeded the comparable figures for whites and for hispanics a pattern that has prevailed for at least the past two decades . the overall labor force participation rate edged up in june and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose a bit . the rate of private sector job openings decreased in may after having risen for a couple of months while the quits rate and the hiring rate both increased . the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through mid\\u00e2 july . average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months ending in june about the same as over the comparable period a year earlier but a little slower than the rate of increase in late .total industrial production rose moderately on balance in may and june as an increase in the output of mines and utilities more than offset a net decline in manufacturing production . automakers assembly schedules indicated that motor vehicle production would edge down again in the third quarter likely reflecting a somewhat elevated level of dealers inventories and a slowing in the pace of vehicle sales last quarter . however broader indicators of manufacturing production such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in factory output over the near term.real pce appeared to have rebounded in the second quarter after increasing only modestly in the first quarter . much of the rebound looked to have been concentrated in spending on energy services and energy goods which was held down by unseasonably warm weather earlier in the year . the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the bureau of economic analysis to construct its estimate of pce declined in june but rose on net in the second quarter . light motor vehicle sales edged down further in june . however recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including continued gains in employment real disposable personal income and households net worth pointed to solid growth in total real pce in the near term . consumer sentiment as measured by the university of michigan surveys of consumers remained upbeat despite having moved down in early july.residential investment seemed to have declined in the second quarter . starts of both new single family homes and multifamily units rose in june but still decreased for the second quarter as a whole . the issuance of building permits for both types of housing was lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter . sales of existing homes decreased on net in may and june and new home sales in may partly reversed the previous month s decline.real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to have increased moderately in the second quarter after a solid gain in the first quarter . nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose again in may and new orders of these goods continued to exceed shipments pointing to further gains in shipments in the near term . in addition indicators of business sentiment remained upbeat . investment in nonresidential structures appeared to have risen at a markedly slower pace in the second quarter than in the first . firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining declined further in may and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector leveled out in recent weeks after increasing steadily for the past year.nominal outlays for defense through june pointed to an increase in real federal government purchases in the second quarter . however real purchases by state and local governments appeared to have declined . payrolls for state and local governments expanded during the second quarter but nominal construction spending by these governments decreased on net in april and may.the nominal u.s . international trade deficit narrowed in may with an increase in exports and a small decline in imports . export growth was led by consumer goods automotive products and services . the import decline was driven by consumer goods and automotive products . the available data suggested that net exports were a slight drag on real gdp growth in the second quarter.total u.s . consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased percent over the months ending in may . core pce price inflation was also percent over that same period . over the months ending in june the consumer price index cpi rose percent while core cpi inflation was percent . the median of inflation expectations over the next to years from the michigan survey edged up both in june and in the preliminary reading for july . other measures of longer\\u00e2 run inflation expectations were generally little changed on balance in recent months although those from the desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants had ticked down recently.incoming data suggested that economic growth continued to firm abroad especially among advanced foreign economies afes . the pickup in advanced economy demand also contributed to relatively strong growth in china and emerging asia but growth in latin america remained relatively weak partly reflecting tight monetary and fiscal policies . despite the stronger momentum of economic activity in the afes headline inflation declined sharply in the second quarter largely reflecting lower retail energy prices and core inflation stayed subdued in many afes . although inflation was also low in most emerging market economies emes it remained elevated in mexico because of rising food inflation and earlier peso depreciation.staff review of the financial situationdomestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period . u.s . equity prices rose longer term treasury yields increased slightly and the dollar depreciated . the committee s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at the june meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and market participants reportedly viewed fomc communications as largely in line with expectations . financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households generally remained supportive of growth in spending.fomc communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as broadly in line with investors expectations that the committee would continue to remove policy accommodation at a gradual pace . market participants generally interpreted the information on reinvestment policy provided in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans as consistent with their expectation that a change to reinvestment policy was likely to occur this year . market participants also took note of the summary in the june minutes of the committee s discussion of the progress toward the committee s percent longer run inflation objective and the extent to which recent softness in price data reflected idiosyncratic factors . overnight index swap rates pointed to little change in the expected path of the federal funds rate on net.yields on intermediate and longer term nominal treasury securities increased slightly over the intermeeting period . although yields fell following the publication of lower than expected cpi data yields were boosted by comments from foreign central bank officials that investors read as pointing to less accommodative monetary policies abroad than previously expected . measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation protected securities ticked up since the june fomc meeting . despite their intermeeting period gains longer term real and nominal treasury yields remained very low by historical standards apparently weighed down by accommodative monetary policies abroad and possibly by declines in the long term neutral real interest rate over recent years.broad u.s . equity price indexes rose . one\\u00e2 month ahead option implied volatility of the s p index the vix remained at historically low levels . spreads of yields on investment and speculative grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over comparable maturity treasury securities narrowed a bit on net.conditions in short term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period . reflecting the fomc s policy action in june yields on a broad set of money market instruments moved about basis points higher . however over much of the period the net increase in rates on shorter dated treasury bills was smaller reportedly reflecting a reduction in treasury bill supply.financing for large nonfinancial firms remained readily available al though debt issuance moderated . gross issuance of corporate bonds stepped down in june from a strong pace in may while issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued to be robust . commercial and industrial lending by banks remained quite weak in the second quarter . responses from the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible and that banks lending standards were little changed in recent months . the most cited reason for the lackluster loan demand was subdued investment spending by nonfinancial businesses but banks also reported that some borrowers had shifted to other sources of external financing or to internally generated funds.financing conditions for commercial real estate cre remained accommodative although the growth of cre loans on banks books slowed somewhat . respondents to the july sloos reported tightening credit standards for these loans . sloos respondents also reported that standards on cre loans were tight relative to their historical range and that on net demand for cre loans weakened in recent months . the pace of issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs through the first half of the year was similar to that seen last year . delinquency rates on loans in cmbs pools originated before the financial crisis continued to increase.financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed and flows of new credit continued at a moderate pace . however growth of mortgage loans on banks books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year . sloos respondents on net reported that standards on most residential mortgage loan categories eased slightly.consumer credit continued to grow on a year over year basis but the expansion of credit card and auto loan balances appeared to slow from the rapid pace that was evident through the end of last year . in the july sloos banks reported having tightened standards and widened spreads for credit card and auto loans on net . standards for the subprime segments of these loan types were particularly tight compared with their historical ranges . reflecting in part continued tightening of lending standards consumer loan growth at banks moderated further in the second quarter however that weakness was partially offset by more robust lending by credit unions.since the june fomc meeting the broad dollar depreciated percent weakening more against afe currencies than against eme currencies . the dollar s depreciation was driven in part by policy communications from the central banks of several afes that market participants viewed as less accommodative than expected as well as by weaker than expected cpi data in the united states . the bank of canada raised its policy rate in july . sovereign yields increased notably in canada germany and the united kingdom . changes in foreign equity indexes were mixed over the intermeeting period european equities edged lower japanese equities were little changed and eme equities increased . european peripheral sovereign bond spreads narrowed over the period reflecting in part positive sentiment related to the outcomes of the french parliamentary election greek debt negotiations and bank resolutions in italy . eme sovereign spreads were little changed on net.the staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability indicating that it continued to judge the vulnerabilities of the u.s financial system as moderate on balance . this overall assessment incorporated the staff s judgment that since the april assessment vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures had edged up from notable to elevated as asset prices remained high or climbed further risk spreads narrowed and expected and actual volatility remained muted in a range of financial markets . however the staff continued to view vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage as well as maturity and liquidity transformation as low and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate.staff economic outlookthe u.s . economic projection prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast . in particular real gdp growth which was modest in the first quarter was still expected to have stepped up to a solid pace in the second quarter and to maintain roughly the same rate of increase in the second half of the year . in this projection the staff scaled back its assumptions regarding the magnitude and duration of fiscal policy expansion in the coming years . however the effect of this change on the projection for real gdp over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and for longer term interest rates . thus as in the june projection the staff projected that real gdp would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in through . the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate over this period.the staff s forecast for consumer price inflation as measured by the change in the pce price index was revised down slightly for in response to weaker than expected incoming data for inflation . as a result inflation this year was expected to be similar in magnitude to last year with an upturn in the prices for food and non energy imports offset by a slower increase in core pce prices and weaker energy prices . beyond the forecast was little revised from the previous projection as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory . the staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the committee s longer run objective in and at percent in .the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past years . on the one hand many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than late last year on the other hand uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated . the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced . the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced . downside risks included the possibilities that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down that the dollar could appreciate substantially or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected . these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined on net over the same period . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis both overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent overall with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market were little changed on balance since the june fomc meeting . participants continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . in light of continued low recent readings on inflation participants expected that inflation on a month basis would remain somewhat below percent in the near term . however most participants judged that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term.data received over the intermeeting period reinforced earlier indications that real gdp growth had turned up after having been slow in the first quarter of this year . as anticipated growth in household spending appeared to have been stronger in the second quarter after its first quarter weakness . reports from district contacts on consumer spending were generally positive . however sales of motor vehicles had softened and automakers were reportedly adjusting production and assessing whether the underlying demand for automobiles had declined . participants noted that the fundamentals underpinning consumption growth including increases in payrolls remained solid . however the weakness in retail sales in june offered a note of caution.reports from district contacts on both manufacturing and services were also generally consistent with moderate growth in economic activity overall . construction sector contacts were generally upbeat . reports on the energy sector indicated that activity was continuing to expand albeit more slowly than previously survey evidence suggested that oil drilling remained profitable in some locations at current oil prices . the agricultural sector remained weak and some regions were experiencing drought conditions . a couple of participants had received indications from contacts that business investment spending in their districts might strengthen.nevertheless several participants noted that uncertainty about the course of federal government policy including in the areas of fiscal policy trade and health care was tending to weigh down firms spending and hiring plans . in addition a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected . it was also observed that the budgets of some state and local governments were under strain limiting growth in their expenditures . in contrast the prospects for u.s . exports had been boosted by a brighter international economic outlook.participants noted that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period . the unemployment rate rose slightly to . percent in june but remained low by historical standards . payroll gains picked up substantially in june . in addition the employment to population ratio increased . participants observed that the unemployment rate was likely close to or below its longer run normal rate and could decline further if as expected growth in output remained somewhat in excess of the potential growth rate . a few participants expressed concerns about the possibility of substantially overshooting full employment with one citing past difficulties in achieving a soft landing . district contacts confirmed tightness in the labor market but relayed little evidence of wage pressures although some firms were reportedly attempting to attract workers with a variety of nonwage benefits . the absence of sizable wage pressures also seemed to be confirmed by most aggregate wage measures . however a few participants suggested that in a tight labor market measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of less experienced workers at lower wages than those of established workers . in addition a number of participants suggested that the rate of increase in nominal wages was not low in relation to the rate of productivity growth and the modest rate of inflation.participants discussed the softness in inflation in recent months . many participants noted that much of the recent decline in inflation had probably reflected idiosyncratic factors . nonetheless pce price inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis would likely continue to be held down over the second half of the year by the effects of those factors and the monthly readings might be depressed by possible residual seasonality in measured pce inflation . still most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . many participants however saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below percent for longer than they currently expected and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside . participants agreed that a fall in longer term inflation expectations would be undesirable but they differed in their assessments of whether inflation expectations were well anchored . one participant pointed to the stability of a number of measures of inflation expectations in recent months but a few others suggested that continuing low inflation expectations may have been a factor putting downward pressure on inflation or that inflation expectations might need to be bolstered in order to ensure their consistency with the committee s longer term inflation objective.a number of participants noted that much of the analysis of inflation used in policymaking rested on a framework in which for a given rate of expected inflation the degree of upward pressures on prices and wages rose as aggregate demand for goods and services and employment of resources increased above long run sustainable levels . a few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation . however most participants thought that the framework remained valid notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tightening labor market and real gdp growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate . participants discussed possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment . these included a diminished responsiveness of prices to resource pressures a lower natural rate of unemployment the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment lags in the reaction of nominal wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening and restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models spurred by advances in technology . a couple of participants argued that the response of inflation to resource utilization could become stronger if output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels although other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little empirical support.in assessing recent developments in financial market conditions participants referred to the continued low level of longer term interest rates in particular those on u.s treasury securities . the level of such yields appeared to reflect both low expected future short term interest rates and depressed term premiums . asset purchases by foreign central banks and the federal reserve s securities holdings were also likely contributing to currently low term premiums although the exact size of these contributions was uncertain . a number of participants pointed to potential concerns about low longer term interest rates including the possibility that inflation expectations were too low that yields could rise abruptly or that low yields were inducing investors to take on excessive risk in a search for higher returns.several participants noted that the further increases in equity prices together with continued low longer term interest rates had led to an easing of financial conditions . however different assessments were expressed about the implications of this development for the outlook for aggregate demand and consequently appropriate monetary policy . according to one view the easing of financial conditions meant that the economic effects of the committee s actions in gradually removing policy accommodation had been largely offset by other factors influencing financial markets and that a tighter monetary policy than otherwise was warranted . according to another view recent rises in equity prices might be part of a broad based adjustment of asset prices to changes in longer term financial conditions importantly including a lower neutral real interest rate and therefore the recent equity price increases might not provide much additional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and services.participants also considered equity valuations in their discussion of financial stability . a couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations in addition as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability . several participants observed that the banking system was well capitalized and had ample liquidity reducing the risk of financial instability . it was noted that financial stability assessments were based on current capital levels within the banking sector and that such assessments would likely be adjusted should these measures of loss absorbing capacity change . participants underscored the need to monitor financial institutions for shifts in behavior such as an erosion of lending standards or increased reliance on unstable sources of funding that could lead to subsequent problems . in addition participants judged that it was important to look for signs that either declining market volatility or heavy concentration by investors in particular assets might create financial imbalances . a couple of participants expressed concern that smaller banks could be assuming significant risks in efforts to expand their cre lending . furthermore a couple of participants saw as possible sources of financial instability the pace of increase in real estate prices in the multifamily segment and the pattern of the lending and borrowing activities of certain government sponsored enterprises.participants agreed that the regulatory and supervisory tools developed since the financial crisis had played an important role in fostering financial stability . changes in regulation had likely helped in making the banking system more resilient to major shocks in promoting more prudent balance sheet management strategies on the part of nonbank financial institutions and in reducing the degree to which variations in lending to the private sector intensify cycles in output and in asset prices . participants agreed that it would not be desirable for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a reemergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.in their discussion of monetary policy participants reaffirmed their view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation was likely to remain appropriate to promote the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . participants commented on a number of factors that would influence their ongoing assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate . most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed from their earlier projections and continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . however some participants expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation which had occurred even as resource utilization had tightened and noted their increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation . they observed that the committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further and argued against additional adjustments until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the committee s symmetric percent objective over the medium term . in contrast some other participants were more worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further or from the easing in financial conditions that had developed since the committee s policy normalization process was initiated in december . they cautioned that a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation could result in an overshooting of the committee s inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse or that a delay could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind . one participant stressed that the risks both to the committee s inflation objective and to financial stability would require careful monitoring . this participant expressed the view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation would likely strike the appropriate balance between promoting the committee s inflation and full employment objectives and mitigating financial stability concerns.a number of participants also commented that the appropriate pace of normalization of the federal funds rate would depend on how financial conditions evolved and on the implications of those developments for the pace of economic activity . among the considerations mentioned were the extent of current downward pressure on longer term yields arising from the federal reserve s asset holdings and how this pressure would diminish over time as balance sheet normalization proceeded the strength and degree of persistence of other domestic and global factors that had contributed to the easing of financial conditions and elevated asset prices and whether and how much the neutral rate of interest would rise as the economy continued to expand.participants also discussed the appropriate time to implement the plan for reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings that was announced in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans . participants generally agreed that in light of their current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon absent significant adverse developments in the economy or in financial markets . many noted that the program was expected to contribute only modestly to the reduction in policy accommodation . several reiterated that once the program was under way further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments would be centered on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate . al though several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting while accumulating additional information on the economic outlook and developments potentially affecting financial markets.committee policy actionin their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in june indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand.on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy members continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis was expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . members saw the near term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but in light of their concern about the recent slowing in inflation they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . they expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . they also again stated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data . in particular they reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee s symmetric inflation goal . some members stressed the importance of underscoring the committee s commitment to its inflation objective . these members emphasized that in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory consistent with achieving the committee s percent objective over the medium term.members agreed that at this meeting the committee should further clarify the time at which it expected to begin its program for reducing its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner . they updated the postmeeting statement to indicate that while the committee was for the time being maintaining its existing reinvestment policy it intended to begin implementing the balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolved broadly as anticipated . several members observed that in part because of the committee s various communications regarding the change any reaction in financial markets to such a change would likely be limited.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at p.m. effective july the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend holiday or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of . percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of billion per day.the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities . the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions . the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at p.m. information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year . job gains have been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate has declined . household spending and business fixed investment have continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed on balance.consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability . the committee continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis is expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments . the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal . the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . however the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.for the time being the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction . the committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated this program is described in the

federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday september at a.m. and continued on wednesday september at a.m.developments in financial markets and open market operationsthe manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets . nominal treasury yields declined notably over the period driven by weaker than expected data releases\\u00e2 especially the july employment report in early august\\u00e2 and policy communications that were seen as affirming expectations that a reduction in policy restraint would begin at this meeting . the decline in nominal yields over the period was primarily attributable to lower expected real yields but measures of inflation compensation declined as well . broad equity prices finished the period modestly higher while credit spreads had come off the very tight levels seen earlier this year but were still narrow by historical standards . overall risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion.the manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early august . that episode saw some large moves in u.s . and foreign equity indexes equity implied volatilities the dollar\\u00e2 yen exchange rate and treasury yields . these sharp moves appeared to be the result of a rapid unwinding of some speculative trading positions induced by unrelated events\\u00e2 such as the unexpectedly inflation focused communications from the bank of japan boj in late july and the weaker than expected u.s . employment report in early august\\u00e2 and amplified by technical and liquidity factors . all told the unwinding process was contained and market functioning recovered relatively quickly.turning to policy expectations the manager noted that the market implied policy rate path shifted down materially . at the time of the september meeting the modal path for the federal funds rate implied by options prices was consistent with about basis points of cuts through year end compared with around basis points at the time of the july meeting . the average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the options implied modal path likely reflecting investors perception that risks were tilted toward more rather than fewer cuts . in the open market desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants most respondents had a modal expectation of a basis point cut at this meeting though the manager also noted that since the time of the surveys\\u00e2 about a week earlier\\u00e2 the probability of a basis point cut at the september meeting implied by futures prices had increased and exceeded the implied probability of a basis point cut . the median respondent s modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years in line with the options implied modal path and was unchanged thereafter . balance sheet expectations in the surveys were little changed from july . most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term the median dealer s most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the july survey and was roughly stable around current levels.in international developments many central banks in advanced foreign economies afes had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period with the bank of england boe deciding to initiate its rate cutting cycle with a basis point reduction and the european central bank ecb and the bank of canada boc delivering their second and third basis point cut respectively . the market implied expectations for year end policy rates fell over the period for most central banks in afes although by a smaller amount than they did for the federal reserve contributing to a modest decline in the trade weighted u.s . dollar index.the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations . unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period . in secured funding markets rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo were higher than a few months earlier amid large issuance of treasury securities and elevated demand for securities financing but were little changed on net over the period . the manager discussed the interconnections between the repo and federal funds markets underscoring the importance of monitoring a range of indicators to assess reserve conditions and the state of money markets . looking at a range of such indicators the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant.usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility declined about billion over the intermeeting period helped by an increase in the net supply of treasury bills . with net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the september tax date before increasing again the staff assessed that the decline in on rrp usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year . the manager also added that with the concentration of on rrp usage in a small number of fund complexes there was an increased risk that idiosyncratic allocation decisions could have an outsized effect on aggregate on rrp volumes.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp had expanded solidly so far this year . the pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . consumer price inflation was well below its year earlier rate but remained somewhat elevated.consumer price inflation\\u00e2 as measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce \\u00e2 was lower in july than it had been in march which had followed some high month over month changes in the beginning of the year . monthly changes in pce prices since april had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year . on a month basis total pce price inflation was . percent in july and core pce price inflation\\u00e2 which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices\\u00e2 was . percent . in august the month change in the consumer price index cpi was . percent and core cpi inflation was . percent both measures were well below their rates from a year ago . the staff estimated given both the cpi and producer price index data that total pce price inflation would be . percent over the months ending in august and that core pce price inflation would be . percent.recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further but remained solid . over july and august average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were less than their average second quarter pace the unemployment rate edged up to . percent the labor force participation rate ticked up and the employment to population ratio ticked down . the unemployment rate for african americans moved down while the rate for hispanics rose and both rates were above those for asians and for whites . the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment edged down to . in august a bit below its level just before the pandemic . job layoffs as measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low through august . measures of nominal labor compensation continued to decelerate . average hourly earnings for all employees rose . percent over the months ending in august and the four quarter change in business sector compensation per hour was . percent in the second quarter . both measures were well below their pace from a year earlier.real gdp rose solidly on balance over the first half of the year . real private domestic final purchases pdfp \\u00e2 which comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentum\\u00e2 posted a stronger first half increase than gdp and pdfp growth over the first half was only moderately slower than last year . recent indicators for third quarter gdp and pdfp suggested that economic growth was continuing at a solid pace particularly for pce and business investment in equipment and intangibles.after growing at a tepid pace in the second quarter real exports of goods moved down in july led by declines in exports of autos and industrial supplies . by contrast real imports of goods especially of capital goods continued to grow at a robust pace in july.real gdp growth in foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter and recent economic indicators suggested economic growth abroad remained subdued . although services activity and high tech manufacturing had been relatively robust overall manufacturing activity remained weak in part due to restrictive monetary policies . weakness in manufacturing was particularly pronounced in canada germany and mexico . in china indicators of domestic demand remained weak.inflation in economies abroad continued to abate on net though developments were mixed . in the afes excluding japan month headline inflation ticked down but remained above target levels due to still high services inflation . in the emerging market economies inflation moved sideways with some latin american economies still experiencing upward inflation pressures from food prices . the boe cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle while the boc the ecb and the bank of mexico eased policy further in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets . by contrast the boj continued to remove monetary accommodation.staff review of the financial situationthe market implied path for the federal funds rate declined notably over the intermeeting period . similarly options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early than they had just before the july fomc meeting . consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path nominal treasury yields declined significantly on net with the most pronounced decreases at shorter horizons driven by reductions in both inflation compensation and real treasury yields . market based measures of interest rate uncertainty in the near term rose notably reportedly reflecting in part increased concerns among investors about downside risks to economic activity.broad stock price indexes increased on net despite a sizable but temporary drop in early august . yield spreads on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds were little changed on net and remained in the bottom quintile of their respective historical distributions . the one month option implied volatility on the s p index ended the period roughly unchanged on net after a large but temporary spike in early august.overnight secured rates were largely unchanged and conditions in u.s . short term funding markets remained stable . average usage of the on rrp facility declined as net treasury bill issuance increased providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds.market based measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most afes fell notably largely in response to declines in u.s . interest rates . the broad dollar index declined with the dollar depreciating significantly against afe currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the u.s . economy and afes . financial markets were volatile early in the intermeeting period following the weaker than expected u.s . employment report and the policy rate increase by the boj which led to the unwinding of some speculative trading positions . however declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period.in domestic credit markets borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments . rates on year conforming residential mortgages and yields on agency mortgage backed securities mbs declined on net but continued to be elevated . interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels . interest rates for newly originated commercial real estate cre loans on banks books increased . yields on an array of fixed income securities including investment and speculative grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs moved lower generally following decreases in benchmark treasury yields.financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and for large and middle market private corporations and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid . for smaller firms however credit availability remained moderately tight . commercial and industrial loan balances at banks were little changed on net . credit remained generally accessible to most cre borrowers . cre loans at banks continued to decelerate in july and were unchanged in august . non agency cmbs issuance was robust in august while agency cmbs issuance slipped to a bit below its post pandemic average.credit remained available for most consumers though credit growth showed signs of moderating . auto lending continued to slow while balances on credit cards increased moderately in july and august on average . in the residential mortgage market access to credit was little changed overall and continued to be sensitive to borrowers credit risk attributes.credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but kept deteriorating in other sectors . the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable . delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre pandemic levels . credit quality in the cre market deteriorated further with the average delinquency rate for loans in cmbs and the share of nonperforming cre loans at banks both rising further . regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre pandemic lows . though consumer loan delinquency rates remained above pre pandemic levels the pace of increases had slowed . delinquency rates for credit cards rose moderately in the second quarter while they were largely flat for auto loans.staff economic outlookthe staff forecast at the september meeting was for the economy to remain solid with real gdp growth about the same as in the forecast for the july meeting but the unemployment rate a little higher . although real gdp growth in the second quarter was stronger than the staff had expected the forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year was marked down largely in response to recent softer than expected labor market indicators . the real gdp growth forecast for as a whole was little changed though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast . over through real gdp growth was expected to rise about in line with the staff s estimate of potential output growth . the unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from through . all told supply and demand in labor and product markets were forecast to be more balanced and resource utilization less tight than they had been in recent years.the staff s inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting primarily reflecting incoming data along with the projection of a less tight economy . both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be percent.the staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected . the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation . the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run . these projections were based on participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy including their projections of the federal funds rate . the longer run projections represented each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy . the summary of economic projections was released to the public after the meeting.in their discussion of inflation developments participants observed that inflation remained somewhat elevated but almost all participants judged that recent monthly readings had been consistent with inflation returning sustainably to percent . some participants commented that though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services . notably core goods prices had declined in recent months and the rate of increase in core nonhousing services prices had moved down further . many participants remarked that the recent inflation data were consistent with reports received from business contacts who had indicated that their pricing power was limited or diminishing and that consumers were increasingly seeking discounts . many participants also observed that inflation developments in the second and third quarters of suggested that the stronger than anticipated inflation readings in the first quarter had been only a temporary interruption of progress toward percent . participants remarked that even though the rate of increase in housing services prices had slowed these prices were continuing to rise at an elevated rate in contrast to many other core prices.with regard to the outlook for inflation almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation . these included a further modest slowing in real gdp growth in part due to the committee s restrictive monetary policy stance well anchored inflation expectations waning pricing power increases in productivity and a softening in world commodity prices . several participants noted that nominal wage growth was continuing to slow with a few participants citing signs that it was set to decline further . these signs included lower rates of increases in cyclically sensitive wages and data indicating that job switchers were no longer receiving a wage premium over other employees . a couple of participants remarked that with wages being a relatively large portion of business costs in the services sector that sector s disinflation process would be particularly assisted by slower nominal wage growth . in addition several participants observed that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance wage increases were unlikely to be a source of general inflation pressures in the near future . with regard to housing services prices some participants suggested that a more rapid disinflationary trend might emerge fairly soon reflecting the slower pace of rent increases faced by new tenants . participants emphasized that inflation remained somewhat elevated and that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.participants noted that labor market conditions had eased further in recent months and that after being overheated in recent years the labor market was now less tight than it had been just before the pandemic . as evidence participants cited the slowdown in payroll employment growth and the uptick in the unemployment rate in the two employment reports received since the committee s july meeting lower readings on hiring and job vacancies reduced quits and job finding rates and widespread reports from business contacts of less difficulty in hiring workers . some participants highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate had risen notably on net since april . participants noted however that labor market conditions remained solid as layoffs had been limited and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had stayed low . some participants stressed that rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings reducing hours or making use of attrition . a few participants suggested that firms remained reluctant to lay off workers after having difficulty obtaining employees earlier in the post pandemic period . some participants remarked that the recent pace of payroll increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis assuming a constant labor force participation rate . many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging with increased immigration revisions to reported payroll data and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors . several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data . participants agreed that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with the committee s longer run goal of maximum employment.with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to percent . participants indicated that in their baseline economic outlooks which included an appropriate recalibration of the committee s monetary policy stance the labor market would remain solid . participants agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring with some noting that as conditions in the labor market have eased the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration.participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and highlighted resilient consumption spending . a couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans . a couple of participants suggested that the financial strains being experienced by low and moderate income households would likely imply slower consumption growth in coming periods . various participants reported that their business contacts were optimistic about the economic outlook though they were exercising caution in their hiring and investment decisions . participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments including increases in productivity had contributed to the recent solid expansion of economic activity and a few participants discussed possible implications of the introduction of new technology into the workplace . many participants emphasized that they expected that real gdp would grow at roughly its trend rate over the next few years.participants discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook . almost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased . as a result those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the committee s dual mandate goals as being roughly in balance . a couple of participants however did not perceive an increased risk of a significant further weakening in labor market conditions . several participants cited risks of a sharper than expected slowing in consumer spending in response to labor market cooling or to continuing strains on the budgets of low and moderate income households . risks to achieving the committee s price stability goal had diminished significantly since the target range for the federal funds rate was last raised and the vast majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced . a couple of participants specifically noted upside inflation risks associated with geopolitical developments . in addition some participants cited risks that progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective could be stalled by a larger than anticipated easing in financial conditions stronger than expected consumption growth or continued strong increases in housing services prices.in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation had made further progress toward the committee s objective but remained somewhat elevated . almost all participants expressed greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks all participants agreed that it was appropriate to ease the stance of monetary policy . given the significant progress made since the committee first set its target range for the federal funds rate at to percent a substantial majority of participants supported lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent . these participants generally observed that such a recalibration of the stance of monetary policy would begin to bring it into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market . they also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation and would reflect the balance of risks . some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward percent while the labor market continued to cool . however noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low some participants observed that they would have preferred a basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision . several participants noted that a basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved . a few participants also added that a basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization . a few participants remarked that the overall path of policy normalization rather than the specific amount of initial easing at this meeting would be more important in determining the degree of policy restriction . participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings.in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected with inflation moving down sustainably to percent and the economy near maximum employment it would likely be appropriate to move toward a more neutral stance of policy over time . participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants assessments of the appropriate path . those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness . participants generally remarked on the importance of communicating that the committee s monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks and therefore not on a preset course . several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the federal reserve s balance sheet could continue for some time even as the committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate.in discussing risk management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased . some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment . a few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way . several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a stalling or a reversal of the progress on inflation . some participants noted that uncertainties concerning the level of the longer term neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of policy and in their view made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually.committee policy actionsin their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace . job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . members concurred that there had been further progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated . almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent and judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committee s dual mandate.in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . one member voted against that decision preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . members concurred that in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks . members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs . all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook . they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals . members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account

McKay, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of MinneapolisDevelopments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) turned first to a discussion of financial developments. Over the intermeeting period, there were significant swings in asset prices, and financial conditions tightened, on net, as market participants assessed incoming information about the economy. In the United States, near-term policy rate expectations shifted markedly toward the end of the period, particularly after the release of the May consumer price index (CPI) report. Ahead of the release of the report, market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be 50 basis point rate increases at both the June and July FOMC meetings. After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well. Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook.Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury securities ended the period significantly higher, primarily reflecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period. Market participants reported that while liquidity conditions in the market for Treasury securities had been affected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall market functioning had held up. Responding to higher interest rates and some concerns about the growth outlook, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period.The manager turned next to a discussion of developments related to foreign central banks. Most major foreign central banks were proceeding on a path of removing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Several\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094had raised their policy rates 50 basis points over the intermeeting period, and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tightening in order to address inflation risks. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced an end to its asset purchase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in July. Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accommodative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve control target. On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies.Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effective federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates. The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the period. Contacts attributed the downward pressure on secured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevated uncertainty about the interest rate path, which had increased demand for short-term investments. In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in overnight private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider further lifting the per-counterparty limit. Over the longer term, ON RRP usage was expected to fall, with the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate.The deputy manager turned next to a discussion of Federal Reserve operations and related topics. In accordance with the directive to the Open Market Desk, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings began in June, under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $17.5 billion for agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under current staff projections, the SOMA portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly $400 billion by the end of 2022. As noted in the recent SOMA annual report and reported in the Board's first-quarter financial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unrealized loss, reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates. Unrealized losses had no implications for Federal Reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached maturity. The staff projected that SOMA net income would decline and potentially turn negative, with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some liabilities, and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Neither unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve's existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would impair the implementation of monetary policy or the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.On other operational matters, the deputy manager noted that, over the intermeeting period, the Desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility (SRF), resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved, to date, as SRF counterparties.By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information available at the time of the June 14\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quarter. The labor market remained very tight, but there were some signs that momentum was slowing. Consumer price inflation\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as measured by the 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May.Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the increases were widespread across industries.Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period. Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer-run rate of 2 percent.Production and spending indicators were mixed but generally remained strong. Consumer spending and industrial production posted sizable gains in April. However, retail sales declined in May, data on home sales and single-family housing starts moved down in April, some indicators of manufacturing activity weakened in May, and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary June reading. Supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors (such as general merchandise retailers) but to have deteriorated in others (such as materials for home construction). On balance, the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the second quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter.Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. By contrast, real goods exports grew in both March and April after declining in the previous two months, following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and pharmaceuticals, which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April.Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth. In China, activity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on economic activity. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to have an imprint on foreign activity, with persistent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence, especially in Europe. Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further increases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services. Central banks around the world further tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation.Staff Review of the Financial SituationOver the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher on net. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined considerably, on balance, amid elevated market volatility. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), sovereign yields also increased further, and foreign equity price indexes moved lower. Despite further increases in borrowing costs, financing conditions in domestic credit markets remained generally accommodative. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the outlook for credit quality had begun to deteriorate somewhat.Since the previous FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields increased considerably on net. Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings. However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely being interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. The expected federal funds rate path\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094also increased notably on balance. Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net. The stock price declines were largely associated with mixed corporate earnings news early in the period and increasing concerns about the economic outlook amid global policy tightening. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the VIX\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094increased moderately, on balance, remaining elevated relative to its historical distribution and significantly above average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on investment-grade and, to a greater extent, speculative-grade corporate bonds widened notably, on net, reaching levels comparable with those at the end of 2018. This widening of spreads was associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening. Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the May increase in the Federal Reserve's administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money market rates. Spreads on longer-tenor commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed moderately, with no signs of spillovers beyond the stablecoin market following the collapse of a large algorithmic stablecoin. Indeed, CP outstanding increased slightly over the period. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Secured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meeting, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility increased further.Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeeting period amid investors' concerns about further inflationary pressures and major central banks' policy communications suggesting a firmer stance of policy. Interest rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with increased uncertainty about the path of policy rates. Concerns about the global growth outlook weighed on equity prices, and the broad dollar edged up. Implied equity price volatility remained at elevated levels. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro-area peripheral countries widened further. These moves were partially retraced following an unscheduled meeting of the ECB on June 15, at which the ECB indicated that it would take action to address potential fragmentation risk in euro-area sovereign bond markets. Outflows from emerging market-dedicated funds intensified in early May, especially from local currency bond funds, and credit spreads in emerging market economies widened moderately.In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. Credit remained widely available, particularly to higher-rated firms and consumers with higher credit scores. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, especially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance decelerated and initial public offering volumes remained extremely slow in May, while gross issuance of municipal bonds remained robust.Commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks' balance sheets expanded at a rapid pace in April and May. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Small business loan originations through April were in line with pre-pandemic levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available.Residential mortgage credit remained widely available through May for most borrowers. While refinance volumes continued trending lower in April and May amid higher mortgage rates, outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade, likely reflecting a substitution by homeowners away from cash-out refinances. In consumer credit markets, auto loans outstanding grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, consistent with a rebound in auto sales, but slowed in April and May. Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May.Borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sectors since the previous FOMC meeting. Yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds remained well above pre-pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institutional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both April and May. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting period, in line with the increases in MBS and Treasury yields, reaching their highest levels since 2010. In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward.Despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in April, in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the volume of upgrades. In addition, market indicators of future default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent, as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook.Credit quality of business loans on banks' books remained sound, with C&I and CRE delinquency rates continuing to be low through March. Nonetheless, banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. Delinquency rates on CMBS and small business loans continued to decline, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong.Household credit quality remained solid, with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near historical lows. In addition, mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months. While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account holders with below-prime credit scores inched up from low levels. The sizable increases in credit card purchase volumes through March were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments, thus increasing household borrowing only slightly.Staff Economic OutlookThe projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection. The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year. However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2022 and for 2023. The level of real GDP was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year. Labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight, albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection.With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to stronger-than-expected wage growth and the staff's assessment that the boost to inflation from supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than previously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances were projected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints. Similarly, core inflation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024.The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The staff judged that the ongoing war in Ukraine remained a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse developments associated with China's zero-COVID policy were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad.Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In addition, participants indicated that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks.With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment appeared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. Correspondingly, participants indicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment and price stability. An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Participants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improvement in supply constraints, and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of policy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors.In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that consumption spending had remained robust, in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market. Several participants noted that household spending patterns appeared to be shifting away from goods to services. Several participants indicated that some of their contacts reported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Participants generally expected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales, and a couple of participants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably. Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer sentiment had dropped notably in June, according to the preliminary reading in the Michigan survey.With respect to the business sector, participants observed that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook. In many industries, the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain disruptions. Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and agricultural producers' ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expanding their production capacity. Similarly, a few participants noted that, in other sectors of the economy, their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and financing costs. With supply challenges still widespread, contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant, and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time.Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. These indicators included an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage growth. Additionally, most business contacts had continued to report persistent wage pressures as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, some contacts reported that, because of previous wage hikes, hiring and retention had improved and pressure for additional wage increases appeared to be receding.Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust. Several participants observed that labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level because of the unusually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was unlikely to move up considerably in the near term. A couple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity.While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices. As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appropriate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market. With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to diminish over time, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a gradual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024. In light of the very high level of job vacancies, a number of participants judged that the expected moderation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate.Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee's longer-run 2 percent objective, with total PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. They also observed that the 12-month change in the CPI in May came in above expectations. Participants were concerned that the May CPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating, and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persistent than they had previously anticipated. They commented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation, with low- and moderate-income households especially affected. These households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food, energy, and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate-income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, together with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and services. They noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and putting additional upward pressure on inflation. Participants commented on the global nature of inflation pressures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy. Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector. Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submissions, largely in response to higher-than-expected inflation readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints. They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Committee's longer-run objectives by 2024 and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expectations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey. With respect to market-based measures, however, a few participants noted that medium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures were unchanged. While measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants were generally judged to be broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-run 2 percent inflation objective, many participants raised the concern that longer-run inflation expectations could be beginning to drift up to levels inconsistent with the 2 percent objective. These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee's objective.In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations. Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices. Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated. In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals recently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy's underlying momentum. Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the downside. Downside risks included the possibility that a further tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China would have larger-than-expected effects on economic growth.In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation was well above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective, and the near-term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meeting. Against this backdrop, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting. One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points. All participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time.In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee's objectives. In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting. Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.Participants noted that, with the federal funds rate expected to be near or above estimates of its longer-run level later this year, the Committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments. They also remarked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Many participants noted that the Committee's credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Participants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected.At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee's objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee's legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk management perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected. Many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as warranted. On this matter, participants stressed that appropriate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in restoring price stability.Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-related lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee's 2 percent objective. Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis.Committee Policy ActionIn their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. With the effects of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia already materializing, members considered it appropriate to omit from the June statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the U.S. economy. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, members agreed that the Committee would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent at this meeting.Members judged that, with high and widespread inflation pressures and some measures of longer-term inflation expectations moving up somewhat, it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market conditions, members also agreed to remove the previous statement language that had indicated an expectation that appropriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market.Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 1.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 1.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBSreceived in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month.Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.\\\"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. In addition, COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\\\"Voting for this action:Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Lisa D. Cook, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller.Voting against this action:Esther L. George.Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting.President George dissented because she judged that a large increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would add to uncertainty about policy concurrent with the beginning of balance sheet runoff in ways that could unsettle households and businesses and could also adversely affect the ability of small banks to meet the credit needs of their communities.To support the Committee's decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 1.65 percent, effective June 16, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a 3/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 1.75 percent, effective June 16, 2022.5It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093Wednesday, July 26\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009327, 2022.

The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 13-14, 2022. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 13-14, 2022, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the March 21-22, 2023, meeting.1.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.Table 2.

As described in the box \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cForecast Uncertainty,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cGauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s Approach,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February),https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1.Return to table2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis.Return to table3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter.Return to tableForecast UncertaintyThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in pastMonetary Policy Reportsand those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.7 to 5.3 percent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 0.6 to 3.4 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second year, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the third year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cfan charts\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.Back to

to promote operational readiness.market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed . survey evidence suggested that most market participants now anticipated that the fomc would announce at its september meeting a date for implementation of a change in reinvestment policy although a couple of survey respondents expressed the view that the timing could be affected by developments regarding the federal debt ceiling . the survey results also suggested that while views were somewhat dispersed respondents typically expected effects on bond yields and spreads on mortgage backed securities from the change in reinvestment policy to be modest.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the open market desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information reviewed for the july meeting showed that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in june and that real gross domestic product gdp likely expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter . the month change in overall consumer prices as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce slowed again in may both total consumer price inflation and core inflation which excludes consumer food and energy prices were running below percent . data from the consumer and producer price indexes for june suggested that both total and core pce price inflation on a month change basis remained at a pace similar to that seen in the previous month . survey\\u00e2 based measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed on balance.total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly in june and the average monthly pace of private sector job gains over the first half of the year was essentially the same as last year . the unemployment rate edged up to . percent in june the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics declined slightly but remained above the unemployment rates for asians and for whites . in addition the median length of time that unemployed african americans had been out of work exceeded the comparable figures for whites and for hispanics a pattern that has prevailed for at least the past two decades . the overall labor force participation rate edged up in june and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose a bit . the rate of private sector job openings decreased in may after having risen for a couple of months while the quits rate and the hiring rate both increased . the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through mid\\u00e2 july . average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months ending in june about the same as over the comparable period a year earlier but a little slower than the rate of increase in late .total industrial production rose moderately on balance in may and june as an increase in the output of mines and utilities more than offset a net decline in manufacturing production . automakers assembly schedules indicated that motor vehicle production would edge down again in the third quarter likely reflecting a somewhat elevated level of dealers inventories and a slowing in the pace of vehicle sales last quarter . however broader indicators of manufacturing production such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in factory output over the near term.real pce appeared to have rebounded in the second quarter after increasing only modestly in the first quarter . much of the rebound looked to have been concentrated in spending on energy services and energy goods which was held down by unseasonably warm weather earlier in the year . the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the bureau of economic analysis to construct its estimate of pce declined in june but rose on net in the second quarter . light motor vehicle sales edged down further in june . however recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending including continued gains in employment real disposable personal income and households net worth pointed to solid growth in total real pce in the near term . consumer sentiment as measured by the university of michigan surveys of consumers remained upbeat despite having moved down in early july.residential investment seemed to have declined in the second quarter . starts of both new single family homes and multifamily units rose in june but still decreased for the second quarter as a whole . the issuance of building permits for both types of housing was lower in the second quarter than in the first quarter . sales of existing homes decreased on net in may and june and new home sales in may partly reversed the previous month s decline.real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property appeared to have increased moderately in the second quarter after a solid gain in the first quarter . nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose again in may and new orders of these goods continued to exceed shipments pointing to further gains in shipments in the near term . in addition indicators of business sentiment remained upbeat . investment in nonresidential structures appeared to have risen at a markedly slower pace in the second quarter than in the first . firms nominal spending for nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining declined further in may and the number of oil and gas rigs in operation an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector leveled out in recent weeks after increasing steadily for the past year.nominal outlays for defense through june pointed to an increase in real federal government purchases in the second quarter . however real purchases by state and local governments appeared to have declined . payrolls for state and local governments expanded during the second quarter but nominal construction spending by these governments decreased on net in april and may.the nominal u.s . international trade deficit narrowed in may with an increase in exports and a small decline in imports . export growth was led by consumer goods automotive products and services . the import decline was driven by consumer goods and automotive products . the available data suggested that net exports were a slight drag on real gdp growth in the second quarter.total u.s . consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased percent over the months ending in may . core pce price inflation was also percent over that same period . over the months ending in june the consumer price index cpi rose percent while core cpi inflation was percent . the median of inflation expectations over the next to years from the michigan survey edged up both in june and in the preliminary reading for july . other measures of longer\\u00e2 run inflation expectations were generally little changed on balance in recent months although those from the desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants had ticked down recently.incoming data suggested that economic growth continued to firm abroad especially among advanced foreign economies afes . the pickup in advanced economy demand also contributed to relatively strong growth in china and emerging asia but growth in latin america remained relatively weak partly reflecting tight monetary and fiscal policies . despite the stronger momentum of economic activity in the afes headline inflation declined sharply in the second quarter largely reflecting lower retail energy prices and core inflation stayed subdued in many afes . although inflation was also low in most emerging market economies emes it remained elevated in mexico because of rising food inflation and earlier peso depreciation.staff review of the financial situationdomestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period . u.s . equity prices rose longer term treasury yields increased slightly and the dollar depreciated . the committee s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at the june meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and market participants reportedly viewed fomc communications as largely in line with expectations . financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households generally remained supportive of growth in spending.fomc communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as broadly in line with investors expectations that the committee would continue to remove policy accommodation at a gradual pace . market participants generally interpreted the information on reinvestment policy provided in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans as consistent with their expectation that a change to reinvestment policy was likely to occur this year . market participants also took note of the summary in the june minutes of the committee s discussion of the progress toward the committee s percent longer run inflation objective and the extent to which recent softness in price data reflected idiosyncratic factors . overnight index swap rates pointed to little change in the expected path of the federal funds rate on net.yields on intermediate and longer term nominal treasury securities increased slightly over the intermeeting period . although yields fell following the publication of lower than expected cpi data yields were boosted by comments from foreign central bank officials that investors read as pointing to less accommodative monetary policies abroad than previously expected . measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation protected securities ticked up since the june fomc meeting . despite their intermeeting period gains longer term real and nominal treasury yields remained very low by historical standards apparently weighed down by accommodative monetary policies abroad and possibly by declines in the long term neutral real interest rate over recent years.broad u.s . equity price indexes rose . one\\u00e2 month ahead option implied volatility of the s p index the vix remained at historically low levels . spreads of yields on investment and speculative grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over comparable maturity treasury securities narrowed a bit on net.conditions in short term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period . reflecting the fomc s policy action in june yields on a broad set of money market instruments moved about basis points higher . however over much of the period the net increase in rates on shorter dated treasury bills was smaller reportedly reflecting a reduction in treasury bill supply.financing for large nonfinancial firms remained readily available al though debt issuance moderated . gross issuance of corporate bonds stepped down in june from a strong pace in may while issuance of institutional leveraged loans continued to be robust . commercial and industrial lending by banks remained quite weak in the second quarter . responses from the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible and that banks lending standards were little changed in recent months . the most cited reason for the lackluster loan demand was subdued investment spending by nonfinancial businesses but banks also reported that some borrowers had shifted to other sources of external financing or to internally generated funds.financing conditions for commercial real estate cre remained accommodative although the growth of cre loans on banks books slowed somewhat . respondents to the july sloos reported tightening credit standards for these loans . sloos respondents also reported that standards on cre loans were tight relative to their historical range and that on net demand for cre loans weakened in recent months . the pace of issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs through the first half of the year was similar to that seen last year . delinquency rates on loans in cmbs pools originated before the financial crisis continued to increase.financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed and flows of new credit continued at a moderate pace . however growth of mortgage loans on banks books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year . sloos respondents on net reported that standards on most residential mortgage loan categories eased slightly.consumer credit continued to grow on a year over year basis but the expansion of credit card and auto loan balances appeared to slow from the rapid pace that was evident through the end of last year . in the july sloos banks reported having tightened standards and widened spreads for credit card and auto loans on net . standards for the subprime segments of these loan types were particularly tight compared with their historical ranges . reflecting in part continued tightening of lending standards consumer loan growth at banks moderated further in the second quarter however that weakness was partially offset by more robust lending by credit unions.since the june fomc meeting the broad dollar depreciated percent weakening more against afe currencies than against eme currencies . the dollar s depreciation was driven in part by policy communications from the central banks of several afes that market participants viewed as less accommodative than expected as well as by weaker than expected cpi data in the united states . the bank of canada raised its policy rate in july . sovereign yields increased notably in canada germany and the united kingdom . changes in foreign equity indexes were mixed over the intermeeting period european equities edged lower japanese equities were little changed and eme equities increased . european peripheral sovereign bond spreads narrowed over the period reflecting in part positive sentiment related to the outcomes of the french parliamentary election greek debt negotiations and bank resolutions in italy . eme sovereign spreads were little changed on net.the staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability indicating that it continued to judge the vulnerabilities of the u.s financial system as moderate on balance . this overall assessment incorporated the staff s judgment that since the april assessment vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures had edged up from notable to elevated as asset prices remained high or climbed further risk spreads narrowed and expected and actual volatility remained muted in a range of financial markets . however the staff continued to view vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage as well as maturity and liquidity transformation as low and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate.staff economic outlookthe u.s . economic projection prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast . in particular real gdp growth which was modest in the first quarter was still expected to have stepped up to a solid pace in the second quarter and to maintain roughly the same rate of increase in the second half of the year . in this projection the staff scaled back its assumptions regarding the magnitude and duration of fiscal policy expansion in the coming years . however the effect of this change on the projection for real gdp over the next couple of years was largely offset by lower assumed paths for the exchange value of the dollar and for longer term interest rates . thus as in the june projection the staff projected that real gdp would expand at a modestly faster pace than potential output in through . the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate over this period.the staff s forecast for consumer price inflation as measured by the change in the pce price index was revised down slightly for in response to weaker than expected incoming data for inflation . as a result inflation this year was expected to be similar in magnitude to last year with an upturn in the prices for food and non energy imports offset by a slower increase in core pce prices and weaker energy prices . beyond the forecast was little revised from the previous projection as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory . the staff continued to project that inflation would increase in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the committee s longer run objective in and at percent in .the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past years . on the one hand many financial market indicators of uncertainty remained subdued and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook still appeared to be less than late last year on the other hand uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated . the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced . the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced . downside risks included the possibilities that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down that the dollar could appreciate substantially or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected . these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined on net over the same period . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis both overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.participants generally saw the incoming information on spending and labor market indicators as consistent overall with their expectations and indicated that their views of the outlook for economic growth and the labor market were little changed on balance since the june fomc meeting . participants continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . in light of continued low recent readings on inflation participants expected that inflation on a month basis would remain somewhat below percent in the near term . however most participants judged that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term.data received over the intermeeting period reinforced earlier indications that real gdp growth had turned up after having been slow in the first quarter of this year . as anticipated growth in household spending appeared to have been stronger in the second quarter after its first quarter weakness . reports from district contacts on consumer spending were generally positive . however sales of motor vehicles had softened and automakers were reportedly adjusting production and assessing whether the underlying demand for automobiles had declined . participants noted that the fundamentals underpinning consumption growth including increases in payrolls remained solid . however the weakness in retail sales in june offered a note of caution.reports from district contacts on both manufacturing and services were also generally consistent with moderate growth in economic activity overall . construction sector contacts were generally upbeat . reports on the energy sector indicated that activity was continuing to expand albeit more slowly than previously survey evidence suggested that oil drilling remained profitable in some locations at current oil prices . the agricultural sector remained weak and some regions were experiencing drought conditions . a couple of participants had received indications from contacts that business investment spending in their districts might strengthen.nevertheless several participants noted that uncertainty about the course of federal government policy including in the areas of fiscal policy trade and health care was tending to weigh down firms spending and hiring plans . in addition a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected . it was also observed that the budgets of some state and local governments were under strain limiting growth in their expenditures . in contrast the prospects for u.s . exports had been boosted by a brighter international economic outlook.participants noted that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period . the unemployment rate rose slightly to . percent in june but remained low by historical standards . payroll gains picked up substantially in june . in addition the employment to population ratio increased . participants observed that the unemployment rate was likely close to or below its longer run normal rate and could decline further if as expected growth in output remained somewhat in excess of the potential growth rate . a few participants expressed concerns about the possibility of substantially overshooting full employment with one citing past difficulties in achieving a soft landing . district contacts confirmed tightness in the labor market but relayed little evidence of wage pressures although some firms were reportedly attempting to attract workers with a variety of nonwage benefits . the absence of sizable wage pressures also seemed to be confirmed by most aggregate wage measures . however a few participants suggested that in a tight labor market measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of less experienced workers at lower wages than those of established workers . in addition a number of participants suggested that the rate of increase in nominal wages was not low in relation to the rate of productivity growth and the modest rate of inflation.participants discussed the softness in inflation in recent months . many participants noted that much of the recent decline in inflation had probably reflected idiosyncratic factors . nonetheless pce price inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis would likely continue to be held down over the second half of the year by the effects of those factors and the monthly readings might be depressed by possible residual seasonality in measured pce inflation . still most participants indicated that they expected inflation to pick up over the next couple of years from its current low level and to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . many participants however saw some likelihood that inflation might remain below percent for longer than they currently expected and several indicated that the risks to the inflation outlook could be tilted to the downside . participants agreed that a fall in longer term inflation expectations would be undesirable but they differed in their assessments of whether inflation expectations were well anchored . one participant pointed to the stability of a number of measures of inflation expectations in recent months but a few others suggested that continuing low inflation expectations may have been a factor putting downward pressure on inflation or that inflation expectations might need to be bolstered in order to ensure their consistency with the committee s longer term inflation objective.a number of participants noted that much of the analysis of inflation used in policymaking rested on a framework in which for a given rate of expected inflation the degree of upward pressures on prices and wages rose as aggregate demand for goods and services and employment of resources increased above long run sustainable levels . a few participants cited evidence suggesting that this framework was not particularly useful in forecasting inflation . however most participants thought that the framework remained valid notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tightening labor market and real gdp growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate . participants discussed possible reasons for the coexistence of low inflation and low unemployment . these included a diminished responsiveness of prices to resource pressures a lower natural rate of unemployment the possibility that slack may be better measured by labor market indicators other than unemployment lags in the reaction of nominal wage growth and inflation to labor market tightening and restraints on pricing power from global developments and from innovations to business models spurred by advances in technology . a couple of participants argued that the response of inflation to resource utilization could become stronger if output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels although other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little empirical support.in assessing recent developments in financial market conditions participants referred to the continued low level of longer term interest rates in particular those on u.s treasury securities . the level of such yields appeared to reflect both low expected future short term interest rates and depressed term premiums . asset purchases by foreign central banks and the federal reserve s securities holdings were also likely contributing to currently low term premiums although the exact size of these contributions was uncertain . a number of participants pointed to potential concerns about low longer term interest rates including the possibility that inflation expectations were too low that yields could rise abruptly or that low yields were inducing investors to take on excessive risk in a search for higher returns.several participants noted that the further increases in equity prices together with continued low longer term interest rates had led to an easing of financial conditions . however different assessments were expressed about the implications of this development for the outlook for aggregate demand and consequently appropriate monetary policy . according to one view the easing of financial conditions meant that the economic effects of the committee s actions in gradually removing policy accommodation had been largely offset by other factors influencing financial markets and that a tighter monetary policy than otherwise was warranted . according to another view recent rises in equity prices might be part of a broad based adjustment of asset prices to changes in longer term financial conditions importantly including a lower neutral real interest rate and therefore the recent equity price increases might not provide much additional impetus to aggregate spending on goods and services.participants also considered equity valuations in their discussion of financial stability . a couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations in addition as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability . several participants observed that the banking system was well capitalized and had ample liquidity reducing the risk of financial instability . it was noted that financial stability assessments were based on current capital levels within the banking sector and that such assessments would likely be adjusted should these measures of loss absorbing capacity change . participants underscored the need to monitor financial institutions for shifts in behavior such as an erosion of lending standards or increased reliance on unstable sources of funding that could lead to subsequent problems . in addition participants judged that it was important to look for signs that either declining market volatility or heavy concentration by investors in particular assets might create financial imbalances . a couple of participants expressed concern that smaller banks could be assuming significant risks in efforts to expand their cre lending . furthermore a couple of participants saw as possible sources of financial instability the pace of increase in real estate prices in the multifamily segment and the pattern of the lending and borrowing activities of certain government sponsored enterprises.participants agreed that the regulatory and supervisory tools developed since the financial crisis had played an important role in fostering financial stability . changes in regulation had likely helped in making the banking system more resilient to major shocks in promoting more prudent balance sheet management strategies on the part of nonbank financial institutions and in reducing the degree to which variations in lending to the private sector intensify cycles in output and in asset prices . participants agreed that it would not be desirable for the current regulatory framework to be changed in ways that allowed a reemergence of the types of risky practices that contributed to the crisis.in their discussion of monetary policy participants reaffirmed their view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation was likely to remain appropriate to promote the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . participants commented on a number of factors that would influence their ongoing assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate . most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed from their earlier projections and continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . however some participants expressed concern about the recent decline in inflation which had occurred even as resource utilization had tightened and noted their increased uncertainty about the outlook for inflation . they observed that the committee could afford to be patient under current circumstances in deciding when to increase the federal funds rate further and argued against additional adjustments until incoming information confirmed that the recent low readings on inflation were not likely to persist and that inflation was more clearly on a path toward the committee s symmetric percent objective over the medium term . in contrast some other participants were more worried about risks arising from a labor market that had already reached full employment and was projected to tighten further or from the easing in financial conditions that had developed since the committee s policy normalization process was initiated in december . they cautioned that a delay in gradually removing policy accommodation could result in an overshooting of the committee s inflation objective that would likely be costly to reverse or that a delay could lead to an intensification of financial stability risks or to other imbalances that might prove difficult to unwind . one participant stressed that the risks both to the committee s inflation objective and to financial stability would require careful monitoring . this participant expressed the view that a gradual approach to removing policy accommodation would likely strike the appropriate balance between promoting the committee s inflation and full employment objectives and mitigating financial stability concerns.a number of participants also commented that the appropriate pace of normalization of the federal funds rate would depend on how financial conditions evolved and on the implications of those developments for the pace of economic activity . among the considerations mentioned were the extent of current downward pressure on longer term yields arising from the federal reserve s asset holdings and how this pressure would diminish over time as balance sheet normalization proceeded the strength and degree of persistence of other domestic and global factors that had contributed to the easing of financial conditions and elevated asset prices and whether and how much the neutral rate of interest would rise as the economy continued to expand.participants also discussed the appropriate time to implement the plan for reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings that was announced in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans . participants generally agreed that in light of their current assessment of economic conditions and the outlook it was appropriate to signal that implementation of the program likely would begin relatively soon absent significant adverse developments in the economy or in financial markets . many noted that the program was expected to contribute only modestly to the reduction in policy accommodation . several reiterated that once the program was under way further adjustments to the stance of monetary policy in response to economic developments would be centered on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate . al though several participants were prepared to announce a starting date for the program at the current meeting most preferred to defer that decision until an upcoming meeting while accumulating additional information on the economic outlook and developments potentially affecting financial markets.committee policy actionin their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that information received since the committee met in june indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year . job gains had been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had declined . household spending and business fixed investment had continued to expand.on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices had declined and were running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.with respect to the economic outlook and its implications for monetary policy members continued to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis was expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . members saw the near term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but in light of their concern about the recent slowing in inflation they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . they noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee s objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . they expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate and that the federal funds rate was likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . they also again stated that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data . in particular they reaffirmed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to the committee s symmetric inflation goal . some members stressed the importance of underscoring the committee s commitment to its inflation objective . these members emphasized that in considering the timing of further adjustments in the federal funds rate they would be evaluating incoming information to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on inflation were transitory and that inflation was again on a trajectory consistent with achieving the committee s percent objective over the medium term.members agreed that at this meeting the committee should further clarify the time at which it expected to begin its program for reducing its securities holdings in a gradual and predictable manner . they updated the postmeeting statement to indicate that while the committee was for the time being maintaining its existing reinvestment policy it intended to begin implementing the balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolved broadly as anticipated . several members observed that in part because of the committee s various communications regarding the change any reaction in financial markets to such a change would likely be limited.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until it was instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at p.m. effective july the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent including overnight reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend holiday or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of . percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of billion per day.the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities . the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions . the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at p.m. information received since the federal open market committee met in june indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year . job gains have been solid on average since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate has declined . household spending and business fixed investment have continued to expand . on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below percent . market based measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed on balance.consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability . the committee continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further . inflation on a \\u00e2 month basis is expected to remain somewhat below percent in the near term but to stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced but the committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to percent inflation.in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and percent inflation . this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments . the committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal . the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . however the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.for the time being the committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction . the committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated this program is described in the

federal reserve system was held in the offices of the board of governors on tuesday september at a.m. and continued on wednesday september at a.m.developments in financial markets and open market operationsthe manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets . nominal treasury yields declined notably over the period driven by weaker than expected data releases\\u00e2 especially the july employment report in early august\\u00e2 and policy communications that were seen as affirming expectations that a reduction in policy restraint would begin at this meeting . the decline in nominal yields over the period was primarily attributable to lower expected real yields but measures of inflation compensation declined as well . broad equity prices finished the period modestly higher while credit spreads had come off the very tight levels seen earlier this year but were still narrow by historical standards . overall risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion.the manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early august . that episode saw some large moves in u.s . and foreign equity indexes equity implied volatilities the dollar\\u00e2 yen exchange rate and treasury yields . these sharp moves appeared to be the result of a rapid unwinding of some speculative trading positions induced by unrelated events\\u00e2 such as the unexpectedly inflation focused communications from the bank of japan boj in late july and the weaker than expected u.s . employment report in early august\\u00e2 and amplified by technical and liquidity factors . all told the unwinding process was contained and market functioning recovered relatively quickly.turning to policy expectations the manager noted that the market implied policy rate path shifted down materially . at the time of the september meeting the modal path for the federal funds rate implied by options prices was consistent with about basis points of cuts through year end compared with around basis points at the time of the july meeting . the average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the options implied modal path likely reflecting investors perception that risks were tilted toward more rather than fewer cuts . in the open market desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants most respondents had a modal expectation of a basis point cut at this meeting though the manager also noted that since the time of the surveys\\u00e2 about a week earlier\\u00e2 the probability of a basis point cut at the september meeting implied by futures prices had increased and exceeded the implied probability of a basis point cut . the median respondent s modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years in line with the options implied modal path and was unchanged thereafter . balance sheet expectations in the surveys were little changed from july . most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term the median dealer s most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the july survey and was roughly stable around current levels.in international developments many central banks in advanced foreign economies afes had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period with the bank of england boe deciding to initiate its rate cutting cycle with a basis point reduction and the european central bank ecb and the bank of canada boc delivering their second and third basis point cut respectively . the market implied expectations for year end policy rates fell over the period for most central banks in afes although by a smaller amount than they did for the federal reserve contributing to a modest decline in the trade weighted u.s . dollar index.the manager then turned to money markets and desk operations . unsecured overnight rates remained stable over the intermeeting period . in secured funding markets rates on overnight repurchase agreements repo were higher than a few months earlier amid large issuance of treasury securities and elevated demand for securities financing but were little changed on net over the period . the manager discussed the interconnections between the repo and federal funds markets underscoring the importance of monitoring a range of indicators to assess reserve conditions and the state of money markets . looking at a range of such indicators the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant.usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility declined about billion over the intermeeting period helped by an increase in the net supply of treasury bills . with net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the september tax date before increasing again the staff assessed that the decline in on rrp usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year . the manager also added that with the concentration of on rrp usage in a small number of fund complexes there was an increased risk that idiosyncratic allocation decisions could have an outsized effect on aggregate on rrp volumes.by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period . there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period.staff review of the economic situationthe information available at the time of the meeting indicated that real gross domestic product gdp had expanded solidly so far this year . the pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . consumer price inflation was well below its year earlier rate but remained somewhat elevated.consumer price inflation\\u00e2 as measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce \\u00e2 was lower in july than it had been in march which had followed some high month over month changes in the beginning of the year . monthly changes in pce prices since april had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year . on a month basis total pce price inflation was . percent in july and core pce price inflation\\u00e2 which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices\\u00e2 was . percent . in august the month change in the consumer price index cpi was . percent and core cpi inflation was . percent both measures were well below their rates from a year ago . the staff estimated given both the cpi and producer price index data that total pce price inflation would be . percent over the months ending in august and that core pce price inflation would be . percent.recent data suggested that labor market conditions had eased further but remained solid . over july and august average monthly nonfarm payroll gains were less than their average second quarter pace the unemployment rate edged up to . percent the labor force participation rate ticked up and the employment to population ratio ticked down . the unemployment rate for african americans moved down while the rate for hispanics rose and both rates were above those for asians and for whites . the ratio of job vacancies to unemployment edged down to . in august a bit below its level just before the pandemic . job layoffs as measured by initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained low through august . measures of nominal labor compensation continued to decelerate . average hourly earnings for all employees rose . percent over the months ending in august and the four quarter change in business sector compensation per hour was . percent in the second quarter . both measures were well below their pace from a year earlier.real gdp rose solidly on balance over the first half of the year . real private domestic final purchases pdfp \\u00e2 which comprises pce and private fixed investment and which often provides a better signal than gdp of underlying economic momentum\\u00e2 posted a stronger first half increase than gdp and pdfp growth over the first half was only moderately slower than last year . recent indicators for third quarter gdp and pdfp suggested that economic growth was continuing at a solid pace particularly for pce and business investment in equipment and intangibles.after growing at a tepid pace in the second quarter real exports of goods moved down in july led by declines in exports of autos and industrial supplies . by contrast real imports of goods especially of capital goods continued to grow at a robust pace in july.real gdp growth in foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter and recent economic indicators suggested economic growth abroad remained subdued . although services activity and high tech manufacturing had been relatively robust overall manufacturing activity remained weak in part due to restrictive monetary policies . weakness in manufacturing was particularly pronounced in canada germany and mexico . in china indicators of domestic demand remained weak.inflation in economies abroad continued to abate on net though developments were mixed . in the afes excluding japan month headline inflation ticked down but remained above target levels due to still high services inflation . in the emerging market economies inflation moved sideways with some latin american economies still experiencing upward inflation pressures from food prices . the boe cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle while the boc the ecb and the bank of mexico eased policy further in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets . by contrast the boj continued to remove monetary accommodation.staff review of the financial situationthe market implied path for the federal funds rate declined notably over the intermeeting period . similarly options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early than they had just before the july fomc meeting . consistent with the downward shift in the implied policy rate path nominal treasury yields declined significantly on net with the most pronounced decreases at shorter horizons driven by reductions in both inflation compensation and real treasury yields . market based measures of interest rate uncertainty in the near term rose notably reportedly reflecting in part increased concerns among investors about downside risks to economic activity.broad stock price indexes increased on net despite a sizable but temporary drop in early august . yield spreads on investment and speculative grade corporate bonds were little changed on net and remained in the bottom quintile of their respective historical distributions . the one month option implied volatility on the s p index ended the period roughly unchanged on net after a large but temporary spike in early august.overnight secured rates were largely unchanged and conditions in u.s . short term funding markets remained stable . average usage of the on rrp facility declined as net treasury bill issuance increased providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds.market based measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most afes fell notably largely in response to declines in u.s . interest rates . the broad dollar index declined with the dollar depreciating significantly against afe currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the u.s . economy and afes . financial markets were volatile early in the intermeeting period following the weaker than expected u.s . employment report and the policy rate increase by the boj which led to the unwinding of some speculative trading positions . however declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period.in domestic credit markets borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments . rates on year conforming residential mortgages and yields on agency mortgage backed securities mbs declined on net but continued to be elevated . interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels . interest rates for newly originated commercial real estate cre loans on banks books increased . yields on an array of fixed income securities including investment and speculative grade corporate bonds and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs moved lower generally following decreases in benchmark treasury yields.financing through capital markets and nonbank lenders was readily accessible for public corporations and for large and middle market private corporations and credit availability for leveraged loan borrowers remained solid . for smaller firms however credit availability remained moderately tight . commercial and industrial loan balances at banks were little changed on net . credit remained generally accessible to most cre borrowers . cre loans at banks continued to decelerate in july and were unchanged in august . non agency cmbs issuance was robust in august while agency cmbs issuance slipped to a bit below its post pandemic average.credit remained available for most consumers though credit growth showed signs of moderating . auto lending continued to slow while balances on credit cards increased moderately in july and august on average . in the residential mortgage market access to credit was little changed overall and continued to be sensitive to borrowers credit risk attributes.credit quality continued to be solid for large and midsize firms home mortgage borrowers and municipalities but kept deteriorating in other sectors . the credit quality of nonfinancial firms borrowing in the corporate bond and leveraged loan markets remained stable . delinquency rates on loans to small businesses remained slightly above pre pandemic levels . credit quality in the cre market deteriorated further with the average delinquency rate for loans in cmbs and the share of nonperforming cre loans at banks both rising further . regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre pandemic lows . though consumer loan delinquency rates remained above pre pandemic levels the pace of increases had slowed . delinquency rates for credit cards rose moderately in the second quarter while they were largely flat for auto loans.staff economic outlookthe staff forecast at the september meeting was for the economy to remain solid with real gdp growth about the same as in the forecast for the july meeting but the unemployment rate a little higher . although real gdp growth in the second quarter was stronger than the staff had expected the forecast for economic growth in the second half of this year was marked down largely in response to recent softer than expected labor market indicators . the real gdp growth forecast for as a whole was little changed though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast . over through real gdp growth was expected to rise about in line with the staff s estimate of potential output growth . the unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from through . all told supply and demand in labor and product markets were forecast to be more balanced and resource utilization less tight than they had been in recent years.the staff s inflation forecast was slightly lower than the one prepared for the previous meeting primarily reflecting incoming data along with the projection of a less tight economy . both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be percent.the staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected . the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation . the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run . these projections were based on participants individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy including their projections of the federal funds rate . the longer run projections represented each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would tend to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy . the summary of economic projections was released to the public after the meeting.in their discussion of inflation developments participants observed that inflation remained somewhat elevated but almost all participants judged that recent monthly readings had been consistent with inflation returning sustainably to percent . some participants commented that though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services . notably core goods prices had declined in recent months and the rate of increase in core nonhousing services prices had moved down further . many participants remarked that the recent inflation data were consistent with reports received from business contacts who had indicated that their pricing power was limited or diminishing and that consumers were increasingly seeking discounts . many participants also observed that inflation developments in the second and third quarters of suggested that the stronger than anticipated inflation readings in the first quarter had been only a temporary interruption of progress toward percent . participants remarked that even though the rate of increase in housing services prices had slowed these prices were continuing to rise at an elevated rate in contrast to many other core prices.with regard to the outlook for inflation almost all participants indicated they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants cited various factors that were likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation . these included a further modest slowing in real gdp growth in part due to the committee s restrictive monetary policy stance well anchored inflation expectations waning pricing power increases in productivity and a softening in world commodity prices . several participants noted that nominal wage growth was continuing to slow with a few participants citing signs that it was set to decline further . these signs included lower rates of increases in cyclically sensitive wages and data indicating that job switchers were no longer receiving a wage premium over other employees . a couple of participants remarked that with wages being a relatively large portion of business costs in the services sector that sector s disinflation process would be particularly assisted by slower nominal wage growth . in addition several participants observed that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance wage increases were unlikely to be a source of general inflation pressures in the near future . with regard to housing services prices some participants suggested that a more rapid disinflationary trend might emerge fairly soon reflecting the slower pace of rent increases faced by new tenants . participants emphasized that inflation remained somewhat elevated and that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.participants noted that labor market conditions had eased further in recent months and that after being overheated in recent years the labor market was now less tight than it had been just before the pandemic . as evidence participants cited the slowdown in payroll employment growth and the uptick in the unemployment rate in the two employment reports received since the committee s july meeting lower readings on hiring and job vacancies reduced quits and job finding rates and widespread reports from business contacts of less difficulty in hiring workers . some participants highlighted the fact that the unemployment rate had risen notably on net since april . participants noted however that labor market conditions remained solid as layoffs had been limited and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had stayed low . some participants stressed that rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings reducing hours or making use of attrition . a few participants suggested that firms remained reluctant to lay off workers after having difficulty obtaining employees earlier in the post pandemic period . some participants remarked that the recent pace of payroll increases had fallen short of what was required to keep the unemployment rate stable on a sustained basis assuming a constant labor force participation rate . many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging with increased immigration revisions to reported payroll data and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors . several participants emphasized the importance of continuing to use disaggregated data or information provided by business contacts as a check on readings on labor market conditions obtained from aggregate data . participants agreed that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with the committee s longer run goal of maximum employment.with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to percent . participants indicated that in their baseline economic outlooks which included an appropriate recalibration of the committee s monetary policy stance the labor market would remain solid . participants agreed that labor market indicators merited close monitoring with some noting that as conditions in the labor market have eased the risk had increased that continued easing could transition to a more serious deterioration.participants observed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace and highlighted resilient consumption spending . a couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans . a couple of participants suggested that the financial strains being experienced by low and moderate income households would likely imply slower consumption growth in coming periods . various participants reported that their business contacts were optimistic about the economic outlook though they were exercising caution in their hiring and investment decisions . participants noted that favorable aggregate supply developments including increases in productivity had contributed to the recent solid expansion of economic activity and a few participants discussed possible implications of the introduction of new technology into the workplace . many participants emphasized that they expected that real gdp would grow at roughly its trend rate over the next few years.participants discussed the risks and uncertainties associated with the economic outlook . almost all participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook as having diminished while downside risks to employment were seen as having increased . as a result those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the committee s dual mandate goals as being roughly in balance . a couple of participants however did not perceive an increased risk of a significant further weakening in labor market conditions . several participants cited risks of a sharper than expected slowing in consumer spending in response to labor market cooling or to continuing strains on the budgets of low and moderate income households . risks to achieving the committee s price stability goal had diminished significantly since the target range for the federal funds rate was last raised and the vast majority of participants saw the risks to inflation as broadly balanced . a couple of participants specifically noted upside inflation risks associated with geopolitical developments . in addition some participants cited risks that progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective could be stalled by a larger than anticipated easing in financial conditions stronger than expected consumption growth or continued strong increases in housing services prices.in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants noted that inflation had made further progress toward the committee s objective but remained somewhat elevated . almost all participants expressed greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent . participants also observed that recent indicators suggested that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . almost all participants judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks all participants agreed that it was appropriate to ease the stance of monetary policy . given the significant progress made since the committee first set its target range for the federal funds rate at to percent a substantial majority of participants supported lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by basis points to to percent . these participants generally observed that such a recalibration of the stance of monetary policy would begin to bring it into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market . they also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation and would reflect the balance of risks . some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward percent while the labor market continued to cool . however noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low some participants observed that they would have preferred a basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision . several participants noted that a basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved . a few participants also added that a basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization . a few participants remarked that the overall path of policy normalization rather than the specific amount of initial easing at this meeting would be more important in determining the degree of policy restriction . participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings.in discussing the outlook for monetary policy participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected with inflation moving down sustainably to percent and the economy near maximum employment it would likely be appropriate to move toward a more neutral stance of policy over time . participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants assessments of the appropriate path . those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness . participants generally remarked on the importance of communicating that the committee s monetary policy decisions are conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook and balance of risks and therefore not on a preset course . several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the federal reserve s balance sheet could continue for some time even as the committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate.in discussing risk management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased . some participants emphasized that reducing policy restraint too late or too little could risk unduly weakening economic activity and employment . a few participants highlighted in particular the costs and challenges of addressing such a weakening once it is fully under way . several participants remarked that reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could risk a stalling or a reversal of the progress on inflation . some participants noted that uncertainties concerning the level of the longer term neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of policy and in their view made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually.committee policy actionsin their discussions of monetary policy for this meeting members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace . job gains had slowed and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . members concurred that there had been further progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated . almost all members agreed that to appropriately reflect cumulative developments related to inflation and the balance of risks the postmeeting statement should note that they had gained greater confidence that inflation was moving sustainably toward percent and judged that the risks to achieving the committee s employment and inflation goals were roughly in balance . members viewed the economic outlook as uncertain and agreed that they were attentive to the risks to both sides of the committee s dual mandate.in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . one member voted against that decision preferring to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent . members concurred that in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate they would carefully assess incoming data the evolving outlook and the balance of risks . members agreed to continue to reduce the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities and agency debt and agency mbs . all members agreed that the postmeeting statement should affirm their strong commitment both to supporting maximum employment and to returning inflation to the committee s percent objective.members agreed that in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook . they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals . members also agreed that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information including readings on labor market conditions inflation pressures and inflation expectations and financial and international developments.at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the system open market account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive for release at p.m. effective september the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of to percent.conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of percent and with an aggregate operation limit of billion.conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of . percent and with a per counterparty limit of billion per day.roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month . redeem treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap.reinvest the amount of principal payments from the federal reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage\\u00e2 backed securities mbs received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of billion per month into treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding.allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments if needed for operational reasons.engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserve s agency mbs transactions . the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at p.m. recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace . job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low . inflation has made further progress toward the committee s percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.the committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of percent over the longer run . the committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward percent and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance . the economic outlook is uncertain and the committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by percentage

output and employment appreciably overshot their full employment levels although other participants pointed out that this hypothesized nonlinear response had little empirical support.in assessing recent developments in financial market conditions participants referred to the continued low level of longer term interest rates in particular those on u.s treasury securities . average hourly earnings for all employees increased percent over the months ending in june about the same as over the comparable period a year earlier but a little slower than the rate of increase in late .total industrial production rose moderately on balance in may and june as an increase in the output of mines and utilities more than offset a net decline in manufacturing production . despite the stronger momentum of economic activity in the afes headline inflation declined sharply in the second quarter largely reflecting lower retail energy prices and core inflation stayed subdued in many afes . bond yields in advanced economies increased moderately in part reflecting evolving market perceptions of prospects for foreign monetary policies . the median of inflation expectations over the next to years from the michigan survey edged up both in june and in the preliminary reading for july . most saw the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as little changed from their earlier projections and continued to anticipate that inflation would stabilize around the committee s percent objective over the medium term . however over much of the period the net increase in rates on shorter dated treasury bills was smaller reportedly reflecting a reduction in treasury bill supply.financing for large nonfinancial firms remained readily available al though debt issuance moderated . they updated the postmeeting statement to indicate that while the committee was for the time being maintaining its existing reinvestment policy it intended to begin implementing the balance sheet normalization program relatively soon provided that the economy evolved broadly as anticipated . other measures of longer\\u00e2 run inflation expectations were generally little changed on balance in recent months although those from the desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants had ticked down recently.incoming data suggested that economic growth continued to firm abroad especially among advanced foreign economies afes . the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced . a couple of participants noted that favorable macroeconomic factors provided backing for current equity valuations in addition as recent equity price increases did not seem to stem importantly from greater use of leverage by investors these increases might not pose appreciable risks to financial stability . respondents to the july sloos reported tightening credit standards for these loans . according to one view the easing of financial conditions meant that the economic effects of the committee s actions in gradually removing policy accommodation had been largely offset by other factors influencing financial markets and that a tighter monetary policy than otherwise was warranted . this overall assessment incorporated the staff s judgment that since the april assessment vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures had edged up from notable to elevated as asset prices remained high or climbed further risk spreads narrowed and expected and actual volatility remained muted in a range of financial markets . the committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run . many noted that the program was expected to contribute only modestly to the reduction in policy accommodation . the unemployment rate rose slightly to . the absence of sizable wage pressures also seemed to be confirmed by most aggregate wage measures . the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits remained at a very low level through mid\\u00e2 july . changes in foreign equity indexes were mixed over the intermeeting period european equities edged lower japanese equities were little changed and eme equities increased . the overall labor force participation rate edged up in june and the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons rose a bit . participants observed that the unemployment rate was likely close to or below its longer run normal rate and could decline further if as expected growth in output remained somewhat in excess of the potential growth rate . in addition the median length of time that unemployed african americans had been out of work exceeded the comparable figures for whites and for hispanics a pattern that has prevailed for at least the past two decades . although inflation was also low in most emerging market economies emes it remained elevated in mexico because of rising food inflation and earlier peso depreciation.staff review of the financial situationdomestic financial market conditions remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period . in light of continued low recent readings on inflation participants expected that inflation on a month basis would remain somewhat below percent in the near term . percent in june the unemployment rates for african americans and for hispanics declined slightly but remained above the unemployment rates for asians and for whites . investment in nonresidential structures appeared to have risen at a markedly slower pace in the second quarter than in the first . however the staff continued to view vulnerabilities stemming from financial leverage as well as maturity and liquidity transformation as low and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate.staff economic outlookthe u.s . economic projection prepared by the staff for the july fomc meeting was broadly similar to the previous forecast . however most participants thought that the framework remained valid notwithstanding the recent absence of a pickup in inflation in the face of a tightening labor market and real gdp growth in excess of their estimates of its potential rate . however a few participants suggested that in a tight labor market measured aggregate wage growth was being held down by compositional changes in employment associated with the hiring of less experienced workers at lower wages than those of established workers . among the considerations mentioned were the extent of current downward pressure on longer term yields arising from the federal reserve s asset holdings and how this pressure would diminish over time as balance sheet normalization proceeded the strength and degree of persistence of other domestic and global factors that had contributed to the easing of financial conditions and elevated asset prices and whether and how much the neutral rate of interest would rise as the economy continued to expand.participants also discussed the appropriate time to implement the plan for reducing the federal reserve s securities holdings that was announced in june in the committee s postmeeting statement and its addendum to the policy normalization principles and plans . members saw the near term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced but in light of their concern about the recent slowing in inflation they agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent . on a \\u00e2 month basis overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below percent . the rate of private sector job openings decreased in may after having risen for a couple of months while the quits rate and the hiring rate both increased . the committee s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to to percent at the june meeting was widely anticipated in financial markets and market participants reportedly viewed fomc communications as largely in line with expectations . in addition a few participants suggested that the likelihood of near term enactment of a fiscal stimulus program had declined further or that the fiscal stimulus likely would be smaller than they previously expected . much of the rebound looked to have been concentrated in spending on energy services and energy goods which was held down by unseasonably warm weather earlier in the year . responses from the july senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos indicated that depressed demand was largely responsible and that banks lending standards were little changed in recent months .\",\n          \"however noting that inflation was still somewhat elevated while economic growth remained solid and unemployment remained low some participants observed that they would have preferred a basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision . percent the labor force participation rate ticked up and the employment to population ratio ticked down . monthly changes in pce prices since april had been smaller than those seen in the first three months of the year . over through real gdp growth was expected to rise about in line with the staff s estimate of potential output growth . the broad dollar index declined with the dollar depreciating significantly against afe currencies amid a narrowing in interest rate differentials between the u.s . economy and afes . both total and core pce price inflation were expected to decline further as supply and demand in labor and product markets continued to move into better balance by total and core inflation were expected to be percent.the staff judged that the risks around the baseline forecast for economic activity were tilted to the downside as the recent softening in some indicators of labor market conditions could point to greater slowing in aggregate demand growth than expected . looking at a range of such indicators the manager concluded that reserves appeared to remain abundant.usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp facility declined about billion over the intermeeting period helped by an increase in the net supply of treasury bills . the pace of job gains continued to moderate since the beginning of the year and the unemployment rate had moved up but remained low . overall risky asset prices were compatible with continued economic expansion.the manager also discussed the brief episode of elevated market volatility in early august . the unemployment rate was expected to remain roughly flat from through . consumer price inflation was well below its year earlier rate but remained somewhat elevated.consumer price inflation\\u00e2 as measured by the month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce \\u00e2 was lower in july than it had been in march which had followed some high month over month changes in the beginning of the year . several participants discussed the importance of communicating that the ongoing reduction in the federal reserve s balance sheet could continue for some time even as the committee reduced its target range for the federal funds rate.in discussing risk management considerations that could bear on the outlook for monetary policy almost all participants agreed that the upside risks to inflation had diminished and most remarked that the downside risks to employment had increased . all told the unwinding process was contained and market functioning recovered relatively quickly.turning to policy expectations the manager noted that the market implied policy rate path shifted down materially . they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the committee s goals . some participants commented that though food and energy prices had played an important part in the decline in the overall inflation rate slower rates of price increases had become more evident across a broad range of goods and services . for smaller firms however credit availability remained moderately tight . the boe cut its policy rate for the first time in the current cycle while the boc the ecb and the bank of mexico eased policy further in part citing progress toward achieving their inflation targets . the risks around the inflation forecast were seen as roughly balanced reflecting both the further progress on disinflation and the effects of downside risks for economic activity on inflation . with net bill supply expected to decrease as a result of the september tax date before increasing again the staff assessed that the decline in on rrp usage might slow over the coming intermeeting period before resuming later this year . interest rates on both new credit card offers and new auto loans were little changed and remained at elevated levels . however declines in equities mostly retraced over the following weeks and moves in foreign risky asset prices were mixed over the intermeeting period.in domestic credit markets borrowing costs remained elevated despite modest declines in most credit segments . the average path for the federal funds rate obtained from futures prices also shifted notably lower and remained below the options implied modal path likely reflecting investors perception that risks were tilted toward more rather than fewer cuts . a couple of participants noted that rising real household incomes had bolstered consumption though some cited signs of a slowing in expenditures or of strains on household budgets including increased delinquencies in credit card and automobile loans . the staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as close to the average over the past years.participants views on current conditions and the economic outlookin conjunction with this fomc meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from through and over the longer run . most survey respondents did not appear to be concerned about an economic downturn in either the near or medium term the median dealer s most likely path of the unemployment rate for the next few years was only modestly higher than that in the july survey and was roughly stable around current levels.in international developments many central banks in advanced foreign economies afes had begun or continued to lower policy rates during the intermeeting period with the bank of england boe deciding to initiate its rate cutting cycle with a basis point reduction and the european central bank ecb and the bank of canada boc delivering their second and third basis point cut respectively . the real gdp growth forecast for as a whole was little changed though the unemployment rate was expected to be a little higher at the end of the year than previously forecast . similarly options on interest rate futures suggested that market participants were placing higher odds on greater policy easing by early than they had just before the july fomc meeting . regarding household credit quality delinquency rates on most residential mortgages remained near pre pandemic lows . participants agreed that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with the committee s longer run goal of maximum employment.with regard to the outlook for the labor market participants noted that further cooling did not appear to be needed to help bring inflation back to percent . some participants noted that there had been a plausible case for a basis point rate cut at the previous meeting and that data over the intermeeting period had provided further evidence that inflation was on a sustainable path toward percent while the labor market continued to cool . the median respondent s modal path for the federal funds rate shifted down notably over the next two years in line with the options implied modal path and was unchanged thereafter . members concurred that there had been further progress toward the committee s percent inflation objective but that inflation remained somewhat elevated . those who commented on the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy observed that they believed it to be restrictive though they expressed a range of views about the degree of restrictiveness . many participants observed that the evaluation of labor market developments had been challenging with increased immigration revisions to reported payroll data and possible changes in the underlying growth rate of productivity cited as complicating factors . average usage of the on rrp facility declined as net treasury bill issuance increased providing a more attractive alternative asset for money market funds.market based measures of the expected paths of policy rates as well as sovereign bond yields in most afes fell notably largely in response to declines in u.s . interest rates . some participants stressed that rather than using layoffs to lower their demand for labor businesses had instead been taking steps such as posting fewer openings reducing hours or making use of attrition . as a result those participants now assessed the risks to achieving the committee s dual mandate goals as being roughly in balance .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
