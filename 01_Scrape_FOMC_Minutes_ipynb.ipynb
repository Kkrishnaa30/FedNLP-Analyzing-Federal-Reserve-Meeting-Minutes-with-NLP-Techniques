Staff briefings provided an assessment of a \\nrange of monetary policy tools that the Committee could \\nemploy to provide additional economic stimulus and \\nbolster inflation outcomes, particularly in future epi-\\nsodes in which the policy rate would be constrained by \\nthe effective lower bound (ELB).  The staff first dis-\\ncussed policy rate tools, focusing on three forms of for-\\nward guidance\\u2014qualitative, which provides a nonspe-\\ncific indication of the expected duration of accommoda-\\ntion; date-based, which specifies a date beyond which \\naccommodation could start to be reduced; and outcome-\\nbased, which ties the possible start of a reduction of ac-\\ncommodation to the achievement of certain macroeco-\\nnomic outcomes.  The briefing addressed communica-\\ntions challenges associated with each form of forward \\nguidance, including the need to avoid conveying a more \\nnegative economic outlook than the FOMC expects.  \\nNonetheless, the staff suggested that forward guidance \\ngenerally had been effective in easing financial condi-\\ntions and stimulating economic activity in circumstances \\nwhen the policy rate was above the ELB and when it was \\nat the ELB.  The briefing also discussed negative interest \\nrates, a policy option implemented by several foreign \\ncentral banks.  The staff noted that although the evi-\\ndence so far suggested that this tool had provided ac-\\ncommodation in jurisdictions where it had been em-\\nployed, there were also indications of possible adverse \\nside effects.  Moreover, differences between the U.S. fi-\\nnancial system and the financial systems of those juris-\\ndictions suggested that the foreign experience may not \\nprovide a useful guide in assessing whether negative \\nrates would be effective in the United States. \\nThe second part of the staff briefing focused on balance \\nsheet policy tools.  The staff discussed the benefits and \\ncosts associated with the large-scale asset purchase pro-\\ngrams implemented by the Federal Reserve after the fi-\\nnancial crisis.  In general, the staff\\u2019s review of the histor-\\nical experience suggested that the benefits of large-scale \\nasset purchase programs were significant and that many \\nof the potential costs of such programs identified at the \\ntime either did not materialize or materialized to a \\nsmaller degree than initially feared.  In addition, the staff \\npresentation noted that\\u2014taking account of investor ex-\\npectations ahead of the announcement of each new pro-\\ngram\\u2014the effects of asset purchases did not appear to \\nhave diminished materially across consecutive programs.  \\nHowever, going forward, such policies might not be as \\neffective because longer-term interest rates would likely \\nbe much lower at the onset of a future asset purchase \\nprogram than they were before the financial crisis.  The \\nstaff also compared the benefits and costs associated \\nwith asset purchase programs that are of a fixed cumu-\\nlative size and those that are flow-based\\u2014where pur-\\nchases continue  at a specific pace until certain macroe-\\nconomic outcomes are achieved\\u2014and examined the po-\\ntential effectiveness of using asset purchases to place \\nceilings on interest rates.  The briefing also discussed \\nlending programs that could facilitate the flow of credit \\nto households or businesses.   \\nParticipants discussed the relative merits of qualitative, \\ndate-based, and outcome-based forward guidance.  A \\nnumber of participants noted that each of these three \\nforms of forward guidance could be effective in provid-\\ning accommodation, depending on circumstances both \\nat and away from the ELB.  They also suggested that \\ndifferent types of forward guidance would likely be \\nneeded to address varying economic conditions, and that \\nthe communications regarding forward guidance needed \\nto be tailored to explain the Committee\\u2019s evaluation of \\nthe economic outlook.  In particular, several participants \\nemphasized that to guard against the possibility of ad-\\nverse feedback loops in which forward guidance is inter-\\npreted by the public as a sign of a sharply deteriorating \\neconomic outlook, thus leading households and busi-\\nnesses to become even more cautious in their spending \\ndecisions, the Committee would need to clearly com-\\nmunicate how its announced policy could help promote \\nbetter economic outcomes.  Participants saw both ben-\\nefits and costs associated with outcome-based forward \\nguidance relative to other forms of forward guidance.  \\nOn the one hand, relative to qualitative or date-based \\nforward guidance, outcome-based forward guidance has \\nthe advantage of creating an explicit link between future \\nmonetary policy actions and macroeconomic conditions, \\nthereby helping to support economic stabilization ef-\\nforts and foster transparency and accountability.  On the \\nother hand, outcome-based forward guidance could be \\ncomplex and difficult to explain and, hence, could po-\\ntentially be less effective than qualitative or date-based \\nforward guidance if those hurdles could not be over-\\ncome.  A few participants commented that outcome-\\nbased forward guidance, tied to inflation outcomes, \\ncould be a useful tool to reinforce the Committee\\u2019s com-\\nmitment to its symmetric 2 percent objective.  \\nParticipants also discussed the benefits and costs of us-\\ning different types of balance sheet policy.  Participants \\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMinutes of the Meeting of October 29\\u201330, 2019\\nPage 3\\n \\ngenerally agreed that the balance sheet policies imple-\\nmented by the Federal Reserve after the crisis had eased \\nfinancial conditions and had contributed to the eco-\\nnomic recovery, and that those tools had become an im-\\nportant part of the Committee\\u2019s current toolkit.  How-\\never, some participants pointed out that research had \\nproduced a sizable range of estimates of the magnitude \\nof the economic effects of balance sheet actions.  In ad-\\ndition, some participants noted that the effectiveness of \\nthese tools might be diminished in the future, as longer-\\nterm interest rates have declined to very low levels and \\nwould likely be even lower following an adverse shock \\nthat could lead to the resumption of large-scale asset \\npurchases; as a result, there might be limited scope for \\nbalance sheet tools to provide accommodation.  Several \\nparticipants commented on the advantages and disad-\\nvantages of flow-based asset purchase programs tied to \\nthe achievement of economic outcomes.  On the one \\nhand, such programs adjusted automatically in response \\nto the performance of the economy and, hence, were \\nmore straightforward to implement and communicate.  \\nOn the other hand, flow-based asset purchase programs \\nmay result in the balance sheet rising to undesirable lev-\\nels.  A few participants also commented that, barring sig-\\nnificant dislocations to particular segments of the mar-\\nkets, they would restrict asset purchases to Treasury se-\\ncurities to avoid perceptions that the Federal Reserve \\nwas engaging in credit allocation across sectors of the \\neconomy. \\nIn considering policy tools that the Federal Reserve had \\nnot used in the recent past, participants discussed the \\nbenefits and costs of using balance sheet tools to cap \\nrates on short- or long-maturity Treasury securities \\nthrough open market operations as necessary.  A few \\nparticipants saw benefits to capping longer-term interest \\nrates that more directly influence household and busi-\\nness spending.  In addition, capping longer-maturity in-\\nterest rates using balance sheet tools, if judged as credi-\\nble by market participants, might require a smaller \\namount of asset purchases to provide a similar amount \\nof accommodation as a quantity-based program pur-\\nchasing longer-maturity securities.  However, many par-\\nticipants raised concerns about capping long-term rates.  \\nSome of those participants noted that uncertainty re-\\ngarding the neutral federal funds rate and regarding the \\neffects of rate ceiling policies on future interest rates and \\ninflation made it difficult to determine the appropriate \\nlevel of the rate ceiling or when that ceiling should be \\nremoved; that maintaining a rate ceiling could result in \\nan elevated level of the Federal Reserve\\u2019s balance sheet \\nor significant volatility in its size or maturity composi-\\ntion; or that managing longer-term interest rates might \\nbe seen as interacting with the federal debt management \\nprocess.  By contrast, a majority of participants saw \\ngreater benefits in using balance sheet tools to cap \\nshorter-term interest rates and reinforce forward guid-\\nance about the near-term path of the policy rate.  \\nAll participants judged that negative interest rates cur-\\nrently did not appear to be an attractive monetary policy \\ntool in the United States.  Participants commented that \\nthere was limited scope to bring the policy rate into neg-\\native territory, that the evidence on the beneficial effects \\nof negative interest rates abroad was mixed, and that it \\nwas unclear what effects negative rates might have on \\nthe willingness of financial intermediaries to lend and on \\nthe spending plans of households and businesses.  Par-\\nticipants noted that negative interest rates would entail \\nrisks of introducing significant complexity or distortions \\nto the financial system.  In particular, some participants \\ncautioned that the financial system in the United States \\nis considerably different from those in countries that im-\\nplemented negative interest rate policies, and that nega-\\ntive rates could have more significant adverse effects on \\nmarket functioning and financial stability here than \\nabroad.  Notwithstanding these considerations, partici-\\npants did not rule out the possibility that circumstances \\ncould arise in which it might be appropriate to reassess \\nthe potential role of negative interest rates as a policy \\ntool. \\nOverall, participants generally agreed that the forward \\nguidance and balance sheet policies followed by the Fed-\\neral Reserve after the financial crisis had been effective \\nin providing stimulus at the ELB.  With estimates of \\nequilibrium real interest rates having declined notably \\nover recent decades, policymakers saw less room to re-\\nduce the federal funds rate to support the economy in \\nthe event of a downturn.  In addition, against a back-\\nground of inflation undershooting the symmetric 2 per-\\ncent objective for several years, some participants raised \\nthe concern that the scope to reduce the federal funds \\nrate to provide support to economic activity in future \\nrecessions could be reduced further if inflation shortfalls \\ncontinued and led to a decline in inflation expectations.  \\nTherefore, participants generally agreed it was important \\nfor the Committee to keep a wide range of tools available \\nand employ them as appropriate to support the econ-\\nomy.  Doing so would help ensure the anchoring of in-\\nflation expectations at a level consistent with the Com-\\nmittee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.   \\nPage 4\\nFederal Open Market Committee\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n \\nSome participants noted that the form of the policy re-\\nsponse would depend critically on the circumstances the \\nCommittee faced at the time.  Several participants sug-\\ngested that communicating to the public clearly and con-\\nvincingly in advance about how the Committee intended \\nto provide accommodation at the ELB would enhance \\npublic confidence and support the effectiveness of \\nwhichever tool the Committee selected.  Some partici-\\npants thought it would be helpful for the Committee to \\nevaluate how its tools could be utilized in different eco-\\nnomic scenarios, such as when longer-term interest rates \\nwere significantly below current levels, and discuss \\nwhich actions would best address the challenges posed \\nby each scenario.  Several participants noted that, partic-\\nularly if monetary policy became severely constrained at \\nthe ELB, expansionary fiscal policy would be especially \\nimportant in addressing an economic downturn.  \\nParticipants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they \\nwould continue their deliberations on the Committee\\u2019s \\nreview of the monetary policy framework as well as the \\nCommittee\\u2019s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Mon-\\netary Policy Strategy.  They also generally agreed that the \\nCommittee\\u2019s consideration of possible modifications to \\nits policy strategy, tools, and communication practices \\nwould take some time and that the process would be \\ncareful, deliberate, and patient.  A number of partici-\\npants judged that the review could be completed around \\nthe middle of 2020. \\nDevelopments in Financial Markets and Open Mar-\\nket Operations \\nThe manager pro tem first reviewed developments in fi-\\nnancial markets over the intermeeting period.  Early in \\nthe period, market participants focused on signs of \\nweakness in U.S. economic data with some soft data \\nfrom business surveys viewed as substantiating concerns \\nthat global headwinds were spilling over to the U.S. \\neconomy.  Later in the period, markets responded to \\nnews suggesting favorable developments around Brexit \\nand a partial U.S.-China trade deal.  On balance, U.S. fi-\\nnancial conditions ended the period little changed.   \\nRegarding the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, the \\nOpen Market Desk\\u2019s surveys and market-based indica-\\ntors pointed to a high likelihood of a 25 basis point cut \\nin the target range at the October meeting.  The proba-\\nbility that survey respondents placed on this outcome \\nwas broadly similar to the probability of a 25 basis point \\ncut ahead of the July and September meetings.  Further \\nahead, the path implied by the medians of survey re-\\nspondents\\u2019 modal forecasts for the federal funds rate re-\\nmained essentially flat after this meeting.  Meanwhile, the \\nmarket-implied path suggested that investors expected \\naround 25 basis points of additional easing by the end of \\n2020, after the anticipated easing at this meeting.  \\nThe manager pro tem next turned to a review of money \\nmarket developments since early October.  On Octo-\\nber 11, the Committee announced its decision to main-\\ntain reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early \\nSeptember through a program of Treasury bill purchases \\nand repurchase agreement (repo) operations.  After the \\nannouncement, the Desk conducted regular operations \\nthat offered at least $75 billion in overnight repo funding \\nand between $135 and $170 billion in term funding.  \\nThese operations fostered conditions that helped main-\\ntain the federal funds rate within the target range \\nthrough two channels.  First, they provided funding in \\nrepo markets that dampened repo market pressure that \\nwould otherwise have passed through to the federal \\nfunds market, and second, they increased the supply of \\nreserves in the banking system.  In anticipation of an-\\nother projected sharp decline in reserves and expected \\nrate pressures around October 31, the Desk announced \\nan increase in the size of overnight repos to $120 billion, \\nand an increase in the size of the two term repo opera-\\ntions that crossed the October month-end to $45 billion.   \\nWith respect to purchases of Treasury bills for reserve \\nmanagement purposes, the Desk had purchased more \\nthan half of the initial $60 billion monthly amount for \\nOctober, and propositions at the five operations con-\\nducted to date had been strong.  Respondents to the \\nDesk surveys expected reserve management purchases \\nof Treasury bills to continue at the same pace for some \\ntime.  The combination of repo operations and bill pur-\\nchases lifted reserve levels above those observed in early \\nSeptember.   \\nThe manager pro tem noted that diminished willingness \\nof some dealers to intermediate across money markets \\nahead of the year-end could result in upward pressure on \\nshort-term money market rates.  Forward measures of \\nmarket pricing continued to indicate expectations for \\nsuch pressures around the year-end.  The Desk planned \\nto continue its close monitoring of reserves and money \\nmarket conditions, as well as dealer participation in repo \\noperations, particularly given balance sheet constraints \\nheading into year-end.  The Desk discussed its intentions \\nto further adjust operations around year-end as needed \\nto mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could \\nadversely affect policy implementation, and to maintain \\nover time a level of reserve balances at or above those \\nthat prevailed in early September.   \\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMinutes of the Meeting of October 29\\u201330, 2019\\nPage 5\\n \\nThe manager pro tem finished by noting that the Federal \\nReserve Bank of New York would soon release a request \\nfor public comment on a plan to publish a series of back-\\nward looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) \\naverages and a daily SOFR index to support the transi-\\ntion away from instruments based on LIBOR (London \\ninterbank offered rate).  Publication of these series was \\nexpected to begin in the first half of 2020. \\nBy unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk\\u2019s \\ndomestic transactions over the intermeeting period. \\nThere were no intervention operations in foreign curren-\\ncies for the System\\u2019s account during the intermeeting pe-\\nriod. \\nReview of Options for Repo Operations to Support \\nControl of the Federal Funds Rate \\nThe staff briefed participants on the recent experience \\nwith using repo operations to support control of the fed-\\neral funds rate and on possibly maintaining a role for \\nrepo operations in the monetary policy implementation \\nframework over the longer run.  Ongoing capacity for \\nrepo operations could be viewed as useful in an ample-\\nreserves regime as a way of providing insurance against \\nunexpected stresses in money markets that could drive \\nthe federal funds rate outside the Committee\\u2019s target \\nrange over a sustained period.  The staff presented two \\npotential approaches for conducting repo operations if \\nthe Committee decided to maintain an ongoing role for \\nsuch operations.  Under the first approach, the Desk \\nwould conduct modestly sized, relatively frequent repo \\noperations designed to provide a high degree of readi-\\nness should the need for larger operations arise; under \\nthe second approach, the FOMC would establish a \\nstanding fixed-rate facility that could serve as an auto-\\nmatic money market stabilizer.8  Assessing these two ap-\\nproaches involved several considerations, including the \\ndegree of assurance of control over the federal funds \\nrate, the likelihood that participation in the Federal Re-\\nserve\\u2019s repo operations could become stigmatized, the \\npossibility that the operations could encourage the Fed-\\neral Reserve\\u2019s counterparties to take on excessive liquid-\\nity risks in their portfolios, and the potential disinterme-\\ndiation of financial transactions currently undertaken by \\nprivate counterparties.  Regular, modestly sized repo op-\\nerations likely would pose relatively little risk of stigma \\nor moral hazard, but they may provide less assurance of \\ncontrol over the federal funds rate because it might be \\ndifficult for the Federal Reserve to anticipate money \\n                                                           \\n8 The staff briefed the Committee in June 2019 on the possible \\nrole of a standing repo facility in the monetary policy imple-\\nmentation framework. \\nmarket pressures and scale up its repo operations ac-\\ncordingly.  A standing fixed-rate repo facility would \\nlikely provide substantial assurance of control over the \\nfederal funds rate, but use of the facility could become \\nstigmatized, particularly if the rate was set at a relatively \\nhigh level.  Conversely, a standing facility with a rate set \\nat a relatively low level could result in larger and more \\nfrequent repo operations than would be appropriate.  \\nAnd by effectively standing ready to provide a form of \\nliquidity on an as-needed basis, such a facility could in-\\ncrease the risk that some institutions may take on an un-\\ndesirably high amount of liquidity risk.   \\nIn their comments following the staff presentation, par-\\nticipants emphasized the importance of maintaining re-\\nserves at a level consistent with the Committee\\u2019s choice \\nof an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation \\nframework, in which control over the level of the federal \\nfunds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of \\nthe Federal Reserve\\u2019s administered rates and in which \\nactive management of the supply of reserves is not re-\\nquired.  Some participants indicated that, in such an en-\\nvironment, they would have some tolerance for allowing \\nthe federal funds rate to vary from day to day and to \\nmove occasionally outside its target range, especially in \\nthose instances associated with easily identifiable tech-\\nnical events; a couple of participants expressed discom-\\nfort with such misses.   \\nParticipants expressed a range of views on the relative \\nmerits of the two approaches described by the staff for \\nconducting repo operations.  Many participants noted \\nthat, once an ample supply of reserves is firmly estab-\\nlished, there might be little need for a standing repo fa-\\ncility or for frequent repo operations.  Some of these \\nparticipants indicated that a basic principle in imple-\\nmenting an ample-reserves framework is to maintain re-\\nserves on an ongoing basis at levels that would obviate \\nthe need for open market operations to address pres-\\nsures in funding markets in all but exceptional circum-\\nstances.  Many participants remarked, however, that \\neven in an environment with ample reserves, a standing \\nfacility could serve as a useful backstop to support con-\\ntrol of the federal funds rate in the event of outsized \\nshocks to the system.  Several of these participants also \\nsuggested that, if a standing facility were created that al-\\nlowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities \\nholdings at times of market stress, banks could possibly \\nreduce their demand for reserves in normal times, which \\nPage 6\\nFederal Open Market Committee\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n \\ncould make it feasible for the monetary policy imple-\\nmentation framework to operate with a significantly \\nsmaller quantity of reserves than would otherwise be \\nneeded.  A couple of participants pointed out that estab-\\nlishing a standing facility would be similar to the practice \\nof some other major central banks.  A number of partic-\\nipants noted that, before deciding whether to implement \\na standing repo facility, additional work would be neces-\\nsary to assess the likely implications of different design \\nchoices for a standing repo facility, such as pricing, eligi-\\nble counterparties, and the set of acceptable collateral.  \\nEchoing issues raised at the Committee\\u2019s June 2019 \\nmeeting, various participants commented on the need to \\ncarefully evaluate these design choices to guard against \\nthe potential for moral hazard, stigma, disintermediation \\nrisk, or excessive volatility in the Federal Reserve\\u2019s bal-\\nance sheet.  A couple of other participants suggested that \\nan approach based on modestly sized, frequent repo op-\\nerations that could be quickly and substantially ramped \\nup in response to emerging market pressures would mit-\\nigate the moral hazard, disintermediation, and stigmati-\\nzation risks associated with a standing repo facility. \\nParticipants made no decisions at this meeting on the \\nlonger-run role of repo operations in the ample-reserves \\nregime or on an approach for conducting repo opera-\\ntions over the longer run.  They generally agreed that \\nthey should continue to monitor the market effects of \\nthe Federal Reserve\\u2019s ongoing repo operations and \\nTreasury bill purchases and that additional analysis of the \\nrecent period of money market dislocations or of fluctu-\\nations in the Federal Reserve\\u2019s non-reserve liabilities was \\nwarranted.  Some participants called for further research \\non the role that the financial regulatory environment or \\nother factors may have played in the recent dislocations.   \\nStaff Review of the Economic Situation \\nThe information available for the October 29\\u201330 meet-\\ning indicated that labor market conditions remained \\nstrong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) in-\\ncreased at a moderate rate in the third quarter.  Con-\\nsumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per-\\ncentage change in the price index for personal consump-\\ntion expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in \\nAugust.  Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation \\nexpectations were little changed. \\nTotal nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a slower \\npace in September than in the previous two months, but \\nthe average pace for the third quarter was similar to that \\nfor the first half of the year.  However, the pace of job \\ngains so far this year was slower than last year, even after \\naccounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of \\nLabor Statistics\\u2019 benchmark revision to payroll employ-\\nment, which will be incorporated in the published data \\nin February 2020.  The unemployment rate moved down \\nto a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in September, while the \\nlabor force participation rate held steady and the em-\\nployment-to-population ratio moved up.  The unem-\\nployment rates for Asians, Hispanics, and whites each \\nmoved lower in September, but the rate for African \\nAmericans was unchanged; the unemployment rate for \\neach group was below its level at the end of the previous \\neconomic expansion, though persistent differentials be-\\ntween these rates remained.  The average share of work-\\ners employed part time for economic reasons in Septem-\\nber continued to be below its level in late 2007.  The rate \\nof private-sector job openings declined in August, and \\nthe rate of quits also edged down, but both readings were \\nstill at relatively elevated levels.  The four-week moving \\naverage of initial claims for unemployment insurance \\nbenefits through mid-October remained near historically \\nlow levels.  Average hourly earnings for all employees \\nrose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem-\\nber, roughly similar to the pace a year earlier. \\nTotal consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price \\nindex, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending \\nin August.  Core PCE price inflation (which excludes \\nchanges in consumer food and energy prices) was \\n1.8 percent over that same 12-month period, while con-\\nsumer food price inflation was well below core inflation, \\nand consumer energy prices declined.  The trimmed \\nmean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation con-\\nstructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained \\nat 2 percent in August.  The consumer price index (CPI) \\nrose 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem-\\nber, while core CPI inflation was 2.4 percent.  Recent \\nreadings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla-\\ntion expectations\\u2014including those from the University \\nof Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Blue Chip Eco-\\nnomic Indicators, and the Desk\\u2019s Survey of Primary \\nDealers and Survey of Market Participants\\u2014were little \\nchanged, on balance, although the Michigan survey \\nmeasure ticked down to the low end of its recent range. \\nReal PCE rose solidly in the third quarter following a \\nstronger gain in the second quarter.  Overall consumer \\nspending rose steadily in recent months, and sales of \\nlight motor vehicles through September maintained their \\nrobust second-quarter pace.  Key factors that influence \\nconsumer spending\\u2014including the low unemployment \\nrate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels \\nof households\\u2019 net worth, and generally low borrowing \\nrates\\u2014were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the \\nnear term.  The Michigan survey measure of consumer \\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMinutes of the Meeting of October 29\\u201330, 2019\\nPage 7\\n \\nsentiment rose again in October and had mostly recov-\\nered from its August slump, while the Conference Board \\nsurvey measure of consumer confidence remained at a \\nfavorable level. \\nReal residential investment turned up solidly in the third \\nquarter following six consecutive quarters of contrac-\\ntion.  This upturn was consistent with the rise in single-\\nfamily starts in the third quarter, and building permits \\nfor such units\\u2014which tend to be a good indicator for \\nthe underlying trend in the construction of such \\nhomes\\u2014also increased.  Both new and existing home \\nsales increased, on net, in August and September.  Taken \\ntogether, the data on construction and sales suggested \\nthat the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 was \\nstarting to show through to housing activity. \\nReal nonresidential private fixed investment declined \\nfurther in the third quarter.  Nominal shipments of non-\\ndefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased over \\nAugust and September, and forward-looking indicators \\ngenerally pointed to continued softness in business \\nequipment spending.  Orders for nondefense capital \\ngoods excluding aircraft decreased over those two \\nmonths and were still below the level of shipments, most \\nmeasures of business sentiment deteriorated, analysts\\u2019 \\nexpectations of firms\\u2019 longer-term profit growth de-\\nclined somewhat further, and concerns about trade de-\\nvelopments continued to weigh on firms\\u2019 investment de-\\ncisions.  Business expenditures for nonresidential struc-\\ntures decreased markedly further in the third quarter, \\nand the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in op-\\neration\\u2014an indicator of business spending for struc-\\ntures in the drilling and mining sector\\u2014continued to de-\\ncline through mid-October. \\nIndustrial production declined in September and was \\nnotably lower than at the beginning of the year.  Produc-\\ntion in September was held down by the strike at Gen-\\neral Motors, and automakers\\u2019 schedules indicated that \\nassemblies of light motor vehicles would remain low in \\nOctober before rebounding in November.  Overall man-\\nufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in \\ncoming months, reflecting generally weak readings on \\nnew orders from national and regional manufacturing \\nsurveys, declining domestic business investment, weak \\nGDP growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade \\ndevelopments. \\nTotal real government purchases rose at a slower pace in \\nthe third quarter than in the second quarter.  Real federal \\npurchases decelerated, reflecting smaller increases in \\nboth defense and nondefense spending.  Federal hiring \\nof temporary workers for next year\\u2019s decennial census \\nwas quite modest during the quarter.  Real purchases by \\nstate and local governments also rose at a slower pace, \\nas the boost from a faster expansion in state and local \\npayrolls was partially offset by a decrease in real con-\\nstruction spending by these governments. \\nThe nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in \\nAugust, reflecting a subdued pace of export growth and \\na moderate pace of import growth.  Export growth was \\nsubdued due to lackluster exports of services and capital \\ngoods.  Advance estimates for September suggested that \\ngoods imports fell more than exports, pointing to a nar-\\nrowing of the monthly trade deficit.  The Bureau of Eco-\\nnomic Analysis estimated that net exports made a slight \\nnegative contribution to real GDP growth in the third \\nquarter.  \\nIncoming data suggested that growth in the foreign \\neconomies remained subpar in the third quarter.  In sev-\\neral advanced foreign economies (AFEs), indicators \\nshowed continued weakness in the manufacturing sec-\\ntor, especially in the euro area and the United Kingdom.  \\nSimilarly, GDP growth remained subdued in China and \\nseveral other emerging economies in Asia, and indicators \\nsuggested that growth in Latin America also remained \\nweak.  Foreign inflation appeared to have moderated a \\nbit in the third quarter, reflecting declines in energy \\nprices.  Inflation remained relatively low in most foreign \\neconomies. \\nStaff Review of the Financial Situation \\nInvestor sentiment weakened over the early part of the \\nintermeeting period, reflecting a few weaker-than-ex-\\npected domestic data releases, but later strengthened on \\nincreased optimism regarding ongoing trade negotia-\\ntions between the United States and China and positive \\nBrexit news.  On net, equity prices and corporate bond \\nspreads were little changed, and the Treasury yield curve \\nsteepened a bit.  Financing conditions for businesses and \\nhouseholds remained generally supportive of spending \\nand economic activity. \\nSeptember FOMC communications were viewed as \\nslightly less accommodative than expected, with inves-\\ntors reportedly surprised by the Summary of Economic \\nProjections showing that a majority of FOMC partici-\\npants anticipated no further easing this year.  Incoming \\ndata early in the intermeeting period\\u2014particularly the \\ndisappointing readings on business activity\\u2014prompted \\na decline in the market-implied path for the policy rate, \\nbut that decline was later partly reversed as market par-\\nticipants apparently grew more optimistic on the pro-\\nspects for a U.S.\\u2013China trade deal and Brexit negotia-\\ntions.  Late in the period, quotes on federal funds futures \\nPage 8\\nFederal Open Market Committee\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n \\noptions contracts indicated that market participants as-\\nsigned a very high probability to a 25 basis point reduc-\\ntion in the target range of the federal funds rate at the \\nOctober FOMC meeting.  In addition, market-implied \\nexpectations for the federal funds rate at year-end and \\nnext year moved down. \\nYields on nominal U.S. Treasury securities moved down \\nin the early part of the intermeeting period but later re-\\ntraced their declines.  On net, the Treasury yield curve \\nsteepened a bit, mostly reflecting a modest decline in \\nshort-term yields.  Measures of inflation compensation \\nover the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on \\nTreasury Inflation-Protected Securities inched down and \\nremained near multiyear low levels. \\nBroad stock price indexes fell by as much as 4 percent \\nduring the first half of the intermeeting period but re-\\ncovered afterward, ending the period roughly un-\\nchanged.  Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in-\\ndex declined slightly and ended the period below the \\nmiddle of its historical distribution.  On net, corporate \\ncredit spreads were little changed. \\nDomestic short-term funding markets were volatile in \\nmid-September and exhibited additional, albeit modest, \\npressures around the September quarter-end and the \\nmid-October Treasury settlement date.  These pressures \\nwere alleviated in part by the Desk\\u2019s overnight and term \\nrepo operations that began on September 17.  After \\nsmoothing through rate volatility over the period, inter-\\nest rates for overnight unsecured and secured funding \\ndeclined roughly in line with the reduction in the target \\nrange for the federal funds rate at the September FOMC \\nmeeting and the associated 30 basis point decrease in the \\ninterest on excess reserves (IOER) rate.  The effective \\nfederal funds rate (EFFR) was more volatile than usual \\nover the intermeeting period, with the EFFR\\u2013IOER \\nspread ranging between 2 basis points and 10 basis \\npoints.  Rates on overnight commercial paper (CP) and \\nshort-term negotiable certificates of deposit declined \\nfairly quickly following the announcement of Desk op-\\nerations on September 17, although some CP rates re-\\nmained elevated into October.  The FOMC\\u2019s Octo-\\nber 11 announcement of Treasury bill purchases and \\nrepo operations to maintain reserves at or above their \\nearly-September level appeared to improve expectations \\nabout funding market conditions through the remainder \\nof the year.  These communications reportedly did not \\nmaterially affect yields on longer-term Treasury securi-\\nties. \\nFinancial markets in the AFEs followed a pattern similar \\nto that seen in the United States.  AFE financial condi-\\ntions tightened early in the intermeeting period on dis-\\nappointing activity data, both in the United States and \\nabroad, and subsequently recovered on perceived better \\nprospects for trade and Brexit negotiations.  Movements \\nin the exchange value of the dollar against most curren-\\ncies were relatively modest, and the broad dollar index \\ndeclined slightly.  Relative to the dollar, the British \\npound appreciated on Brexit developments, and the Ar-\\ngentinian peso continued to depreciate amid the coun-\\ntry\\u2019s political developments. \\nThe mid-September increases in U.S. Treasury repo rates \\nspilled over to borrowing rates in the international dollar \\nfunding market.  However, the measures taken by the \\nFederal Reserve to keep the federal funds rate in the tar-\\nget range also calmed dollar funding conditions in the \\nforeign exchange swap market. \\nFinancing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re-\\nmained generally accommodative during the intermeet-\\ning period.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds, which \\nwas strong in September, experienced a typical seasonal \\ndecline in October.  Gross issuance of institutional lev-\\neraged loans remained solid but slightly below 2019 \\nmonthly averages.  Meanwhile, growth of commercial \\nand industrial (C&I) loans at banks was modest in the \\nthird quarter as a whole.  Respondents to the October \\n2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank \\nLending Practices (SLOOS) reported that borrower de-\\nmand weakened for C&I loans over the third quarter, \\nwhile lending standards on such loans were about un-\\nchanged.  Gross equity issuance through both initial and \\nseasoned offerings picked up to a strong pace in Septem-\\nber but moderated in October.  The credit quality of \\nnonfinancial corporations deteriorated slightly in recent \\nmonths but remained solid on balance.  Credit condi-\\ntions for both small businesses and municipalities stayed \\naccommodative on net. \\nIn the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing \\nconditions also remained generally accommodative.  The \\nvolume of agency and non-agency commercial mort-\\ngage-backed securities issuance was strong in Septem-\\nber, in part supported by recent declines in interest rates.  \\nGrowth of CRE loans on banks\\u2019 books was little \\nchanged in the third quarter.  Banks in the October \\nSLOOS reported tighter lending standards for all types \\nof CRE loans; they also reported weaker demand for \\nconstruction lending and stronger demand for the other \\nCRE lending categories.  \\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMinutes of the Meeting of October 29\\u201330, 2019\\nPage 9\\n \\nFinancing conditions in the residential mortgage market \\nremained accommodative on balance.  Mortgage rates \\nwere little changed since the September FOMC meeting \\nand stayed near their lowest level since mid-2016.  In \\nSeptember, home-purchase originations remained \\naround the relatively high level seen during the previous \\ntwo months, while refinancing originations jumped to \\ntheir highest level since late 2012.  In the October \\nSLOOS, banks left their lending standards basically un-\\nchanged for most residential real estate loan categories \\nover the third quarter.  However, for subprime loans, a \\nmoderate net percentage of banks reported tightening \\nstandards. \\nFinancing conditions in consumer credit markets re-\\nmained generally supportive of household spending, al-\\nthough conditions continued to be tight for credit card \\nborrowers with nonprime credit scores.  Interest rates \\non auto loans fell, on net, since the beginning of the year, \\nand interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off \\nthrough August.  According to the October SLOOS, \\ncommercial banks tightened their standards on credit \\ncards and other consumer loans over the third quarter.  \\nAdditionally, banks reported that their standards on auto \\nloans and their willingness to make consumer install-\\nment loans were about unchanged on balance. \\nThe staff provided an update on its assessments of po-\\ntential risks to financial stability.  On balance, the staff \\ncharacterized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. fi-\\nnancial system as moderate.  The staff judged that, for \\nmany asset classes, valuation pressures eased over the \\npast year.  Appetite for risk in the leveraged loan market \\nremained elevated, but less so than last year, especially \\nfor lower-rated loans.  In addition, CRE prices remained \\nhigh relative to rental income.  In assessing vulnerabili-\\nties stemming from borrowing in the household and \\nbusiness sectors, the staff noted that, while household \\nborrowing continued to decline relative to nominal \\nGDP, business leverage remained at or near record-high \\nlevels.  The risks associated with leverage at financial in-\\nstitutions were viewed as being low, as they have been \\nfor some time, largely because of high capital ratios at \\nlarge banks.  Nonetheless, the staff noted that the resili-\\nence of financial institutions could be undermined by \\nlow interest rates and banks\\u2019 announced plans to in-\\ncrease payouts to shareholders.  The staff assessed vul-\\nnerabilities stemming from funding risk as modest.  In \\naddition, the staff discussed the potential for liquidity \\ntransformation by open-ended mutual funds investing in \\nbank loans to lead to market dislocations under stress \\nscenarios, while noting that outflows from such funds \\nhave not often been associated with such dislocations. \\nStaff Economic Outlook \\nThe projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by \\nthe staff for the October FOMC meeting was revised \\ndown a little for the second half of this year relative to \\nthe previous projection.  This revision reflected the esti-\\nmated effects of the strike at General Motors along with \\nsome other small factors.  Even without this downward \\nrevision, real GDP was forecast to rise more slowly in \\nthe second half of the year than in the first half, mostly \\nbecause of continued soft business investment and \\nslower increases in government spending.  The medium-\\nterm projection for real GDP growth was essentially un-\\nchanged, as revisions to the staff\\u2019s assumptions about \\nfactors on which the forecast was conditioned, such as \\nfinancial market variables, were small and offsetting.  \\nReal GDP was expected to decelerate modestly over the \\nmedium term, mostly because of a waning boost from \\nfiscal policy.  Output was forecast to expand at a rate a \\nlittle above the staff\\u2019s estimate of its potential rate of \\ngrowth in 2019 and 2020 and then to slow to a pace \\nslightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022.  \\nThe unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat \\nthrough 2022 and to remain below the staff\\u2019s estimate of \\nits longer-run natural rate.   \\nThe staff\\u2019s forecast for core PCE price inflation this year \\nwas revised down a little in response to recent data.  Be-\\nyond this year, the projection for core inflation was un-\\nrevised, and the forecast for total inflation was a little \\nlower in 2020 because of a downward revision in pro-\\njected consumer energy prices.  Both total inflation and \\ncore inflation were forecast to move up slightly next \\nyear, as the low inflation readings early this year were \\nviewed as transitory; nevertheless, both inflation \\nmeasures were forecast to continue to run somewhat be-\\nlow 2 percent through 2022. \\nThe staff continued to view the uncertainty around its \\nprojections for real GDP growth, the unemployment \\nrate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of \\nthe past 20 years.  Moreover, the staff still judged that \\nthe risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted \\nto the downside, with a corresponding skew to the up-\\nside for the unemployment rate.  Important factors in \\nthat assessment were that international trade tensions \\nand foreign economic developments seemed more likely \\nto move in directions that could have significant nega-\\ntive effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more \\nfavorably than assumed.  In addition, softness in busi-\\nness investment and manufacturing so far this year was \\nseen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial \\nslowing in economic growth than the staff projected.  \\nThe risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as \\nPage 10\\nFederal Open Market Committee\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n \\nhaving a downward skew, in part because of the down-\\nside risks to the forecast for economic activity. \\nParticipants\\u2019 Views on Current Conditions and the \\nEconomic Outlook \\nParticipants agreed that the labor market had remained \\nstrong over the intermeeting period and that economic \\nactivity had risen at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been \\nsolid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy-\\nment rate had remained low.  Although household \\nspending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed in-\\nvestment and exports had remained weak.  On a \\n12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items \\nother than food and energy were running below 2 per-\\ncent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation \\nremained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in-\\nflation expectations were little changed. \\nParticipants generally viewed the economic outlook as \\npositive.  Participants judged that sustained expansion of \\neconomic activity, strong labor market conditions, and \\ninflation near the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent ob-\\njective were the most likely outcomes, and they indicated \\nthat their views on these outcomes had changed little \\nsince the September meeting.  Uncertainties associated \\nwith trade tensions as well as geopolitical risks had eased \\nsomewhat, though they remained elevated.  In addition, \\ninflation pressures remained muted.  The risk that a \\nglobal growth slowdown would further weigh on the do-\\nmestic economy remained prominent.   \\nIn their discussion of the household sector, participants \\nagreed that consumer spending was increasing at a \\nstrong pace.  They also generally expected that, in the \\nperiod ahead, household spending would likely remain \\non a firm footing, supported by strong labor market con-\\nditions, rising incomes, and favorable financial condi-\\ntions.  In addition, survey measures of consumer confi-\\ndence remained high, and a couple of participants com-\\nmented that business contacts in consumer-facing indus-\\ntries reported strong demand.  Many participants noted \\nthat components of household spending that are \\nthought to be particularly sensitive to interest rates had \\nimproved, including purchases of consumer durables.  \\nIn addition, residential investment had turned up.  Most \\nparticipants who reported on spending by households in \\ntheir Districts also cited favorable conditions for con-\\nsumer spending, although several participants reported \\nmixed data on spending or an increase in precautionary \\nsavings in their Districts.   \\nIn their discussions of the business sector, participants \\nsaw trade tensions and concerns about the global growth \\noutlook as the main factors contributing to weak busi-\\nness investment and exports and the associated restraint \\non domestic economic growth.  Moreover, participants \\ngenerally expected that trade uncertainty and sluggish \\nglobal growth would continue to damp investment \\nspending and exports.  A number of participants judged \\nthat tight labor market conditions were also causing \\nfirms to forego investment expenditures, or invest in au-\\ntomation systems to reduce the need for additional hir-\\ning.  However, business sentiment appeared to remain \\nstrong for some industries, particularly those most \\nclosely connected with consumer goods.  \\nParticipants discussed developments in the manufactur-\\ning, energy, and agricultural sectors of the U.S. economy.  \\nManufacturing production remained weak, and continu-\\ning concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty \\nsuggested that conditions were unlikely to improve ma-\\nterially over the near term.  In addition, the labor strike \\nat General Motors had disrupted motor vehicle output, \\nand ongoing issues at Boeing were slowing manufactur-\\ning in the commercial aircraft industry.  A couple of par-\\nticipants noted that activity was particularly weak for the \\nenergy industry, in part because of low petroleum prices.  \\nIn addition, a few  participants noted ongoing challenges \\nin the agricultural sector, including those associated with \\nlower crop yields, tariffs, weak export demand, and dif-\\nficult financial positions for many farmers.  One bright \\nspot for the agricultural sector was that some commod-\\nity prices had firmed recently.  \\nParticipants judged that conditions in the labor market \\nremained strong, with the unemployment rate near his-\\ntorical lows and continued solid job gains, on average.  \\nIn addition, some participants commented on the \\nstrength or improvement in labor force participation na-\\ntionally or in their Districts.  However, the pace of in-\\ncreases in employment had slowed some, on net, in re-\\ncent months.  On the one hand, the slowing could be \\ninterpreted as a natural consequence of the economy be-\\ning near full employment.  On the other hand, slowing \\njob gains might also be indicative of some cooling in la-\\nbor demand, which may be consistent with an observed \\ndecline in the rate of job openings and decreases in other \\nmeasures of labor market tightness.  Several participants \\ncommented that the preliminary benchmark revision re-\\nleased in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had \\nindicated that payroll employment gains would likely \\nshow less momentum coming into this year once those \\nrevisions are incorporated in published data early next \\nyear.  Growth of wages had also slowed this year by \\nsome measures.  Consistent with strong national data on \\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMinutes of the Meeting of October 29\\u201330, 2019\\nPage 11\\n \\nthe labor market, business contacts in many Districts in-\\ndicated continued strong labor demand, with firms still \\nreporting difficulties finding qualified workers, or broad-\\nening their recruiting to include traditionally marginal-\\nized groups. \\nIn their discussion of inflation developments, partici-\\npants noted that readings on overall and core PCE infla-\\ntion, measured on a 12-month change basis, had contin-\\nued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent \\nobjective.  While survey-based measures of longer-term \\ninflation expectations were generally little changed, some \\nmeasures of households\\u2019 inflation expectations had \\nmoved down to historically low levels.  Market-based \\nmeasures of inflation compensation remained low, with \\nsome longer-term measures being at or near multi-year \\nlows.  Weakness in the global economy, perceptions of \\ndownside risks to growth, and subdued global inflation \\npressures were cited as factors tilting inflation risk to the \\ndownside, and a few participants commented that they \\nexpected inflation to run below 2 percent for some time.  \\nSome other participants, however, saw the recent infla-\\ntion data as consistent with their previous assessment \\nthat much of the weakness seen early in the year would \\nbe transitory, or that some recent monthly readings \\nseemed broadly consistent with the Committee's longer-\\nrun inflation objective of 2 percent.  A couple of partic-\\nipants noted that some measures of inflation could tem-\\nporarily move above 2 percent early next year because of \\nthe transitory effects of tariffs.  \\nParticipants also discussed risks regarding the outlook \\nfor economic activity, which remained tilted to the \\ndownside.  Some risks were seen to have eased a bit, al-\\nthough they remained elevated.  There were some tenta-\\ntive signs that trade tensions were easing, the probability \\nof a no-deal Brexit was judged to have lessened, and \\nsome other geopolitical tensions had diminished.  Sev-\\neral participants noted that statistical models designed to \\ngauge the probability of recession, including those based \\non information from the yield curve, suggested that the \\nlikelihood of a recession occurring over the medium \\nterm had fallen somewhat over the intermeeting period.  \\nHowever, other downside risks had not diminished.  In \\nparticular, some further signs of a global slowdown in \\neconomic growth emerged; weakening in the global \\neconomy could further restrain the domestic economy, \\nand the risk that the weakness in domestic business \\nspending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to \\nslower hiring and weigh on household spending re-\\nmained prominent.   \\nAmong those participants who commented on financial \\nstability, most highlighted the risks associated with high \\nlevels of corporate indebtedness and elevated valuation \\npressures for a variety of risky assets.  Although financial \\nstability risks overall were seen as moderate, several par-\\nticipants indicated that imbalances in the corporate debt \\nmarket had grown over the economic expansion and \\nraised the concern that deteriorating credit quality could \\nlead to sharp increases in risk spreads in corporate bond \\nmarkets; these developments could amplify the effects \\nof an adverse shock to the economy.  Several partici-\\npants were concerned that some banks had reduced the \\nsizes of their capital buffers at a time when they should \\nbe rising.  A few participants observed that valuations in \\nequity and bond markets were high by historical stand-\\nards and that CRE valuations were also elevated.  A cou-\\nple of participants indicated that market participants may \\nbe overly optimistic in the pricing of risk for corporate \\ndebt.  A couple of participants judged that the monitor-\\ning of financial stability vulnerabilities should also en-\\ncompass risks related to climate change.   \\nIn their consideration of the monetary policy options at \\nthis meeting, most participants believed that a reduction \\nof 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds \\nrate would be appropriate.  In discussing the reasons for \\nsuch a decision, these participants continued to point to \\nglobal developments weighing on the economic outlook, \\nthe need to provide insurance against potential downside \\nrisks to the economic outlook, and the importance of \\nreturning inflation to the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 per-\\ncent objective on a sustained basis.  A couple of partici-\\npants who were supportive of a rate cut at this meeting \\nindicated that the decision to reduce the federal funds \\nrate by 25 basis points was a close call relative to the op-\\ntion of leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this \\nmeeting.   \\nMany participants judged that an additional modest eas-\\ning at this meeting was appropriate in light of persistent \\nweakness in global growth and elevated uncertainty re-\\ngarding trade developments.  Nonetheless, these partic-\\nipants noted that incoming data had continued to sug-\\ngest that the economy had proven resilient in the face of \\ncontinued headwinds from global developments and \\nthat previous adjustments to monetary policy would \\ncontinue to help sustain economic growth.  In addition, \\nseveral participants suggested that a modest easing of \\npolicy at this meeting would likely better align the target \\nrange for the federal funds rate with a variety of indica-\\ntors used to assess the appropriate policy stance, includ-\\ning estimates of the neutral interest rate and the slope of \\nthe yield curve.  A couple of participants judged that \\nPage 12\\nFederal Open Market Committee\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n \\nthere was more room for the labor market to improve.  \\nAccordingly, they saw further accommodation as best \\nsupporting both of the Committee\\u2019s dual-mandate ob-\\njectives.  \\nMany participants continued to view the downside risks \\nsurrounding the economic outlook as elevated, further \\nunderscoring the case for a rate cut at this meeting.  In \\nparticular, risks to the outlook associated with global \\neconomic growth and international trade were still seen \\nas significant despite some encouraging geopolitical and \\ntrade-related developments over the intermeeting pe-\\nriod.  In light of these risks, a number of participants \\nwere concerned that weakness in business spending, \\nmanufacturing, and exports could spill over to labor \\nmarkets and consumer spending and threaten the eco-\\nnomic expansion.  A few participants observed that the \\nconsiderations favoring easing at this meeting were rein-\\nforced by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the \\nELB.  In their view, providing adequate accommodation \\nwhile still away from the ELB would best mitigate the \\npossibility of a costly return to the ELB.   \\nMany participants also cited the level of inflation or in-\\nflation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis \\npoints in the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Inflation \\ncontinued to run below the Committee\\u2019s symmetric \\n2 percent objective, and inflationary pressures remained \\nmuted.  Several participants raised concerns that \\nmeasures of inflation expectations remained low and \\ncould decline further without a more accommodative \\npolicy stance.  A couple of these participants, pointing \\nto experiences in Japan and the euro area, were con-\\ncerned that persistent inflation shortfalls could lead to a \\ndecline in longer-run inflation expectations and less \\nroom to reduce the federal funds rate in the event of a \\nfuture recession.  In general, the participants who justi-\\nfied further easing at this meeting based on considera-\\ntions related to inflation viewed this action as helping to \\nmove inflation up to the Committee\\u2019s 2 percent objec-\\ntive on a sustained basis and to anchor inflation expec-\\ntations at levels consistent with that objective.  \\nSome participants favored maintaining the existing tar-\\nget range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  \\nThese participants suggested that the baseline projection \\nfor the economy remained favorable, with inflation ex-\\npected to move up and stay near the Committee\\u2019s 2 per-\\ncent objective.  They also judged that policy accommo-\\ndation was already adequate and, in light of lags in the \\ntransmission of monetary policy, preferred to take some \\ntime to assess the economic effects of the Committee\\u2019s \\nprevious policy actions before easing policy further.  \\nSeveral participants noted that downside risks had di-\\nminished over the intermeeting period and saw little in-\\ndication that weakness in business sentiment was spilling \\nover into labor markets and consumer spending.  A few \\nparticipants raised the concern that a further easing of \\nmonetary policy at this meeting could encourage exces-\\nsive risk-taking and exacerbate imbalances in the finan-\\ncial sector. \\nWith regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, \\nmost participants judged that the stance of policy, after \\na 25 basis point reduction at this meeting, would be well \\ncalibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth, a \\nstrong labor market, and inflation near the Committee\\u2019s \\nsymmetric 2 percent objective and likely would remain \\nso as long as incoming information about the economy \\ndid not result in a material reassessment of the economic \\noutlook.  However, participants noted that policy was \\nnot on a preset course and that they would be monitor-\\ning the effects of the Committee\\u2019s recent policy actions, \\nas well as other information bearing on the economic \\noutlook, in assessing the appropriate path of the target \\nrange for the federal funds rate.  A couple of participants \\nexpressed the view that the Committee should reinforce \\nits postmeeting statement with additional communica-\\ntions indicating that another reduction in the federal \\nfunds rate was unlikely in the near term unless incoming \\ninformation was consistent with a significant slowdown \\nin the pace of economic activity.   \\nCommittee Policy Action \\nIn their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, \\nmembers noted that information received since the Sep-\\ntember meeting indicated that the labor market re-\\nmained strong and that economic activity had been ris-\\ning at a moderate rate.  Job gains had been solid, on av-\\nerage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had \\nremained low.  Household spending had been rising at a \\nstrong pace.  However, business fixed investment and \\nexports remained weak, as softness in global growth and \\ninternational trade developments continued to weigh on \\nthose sectors.  On a 12-month basis, both the overall \\ninflation rate and inflation for items other than food and \\nenergy were running below 2 percent.  Market-based \\nmeasures of inflation compensation remained low.  Sur-\\nvey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta-\\ntions were little changed.   \\nIn light of the implications of global developments for \\nthe economic outlook as well as muted inflation pres-\\nsures, most members agreed to lower the target range \\nfor the federal funds rate to 1\\u00bd to 1\\u00be percent at this \\nmeeting.  The members who supported this action \\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMinutes of the Meeting of October 29\\u201330, 2019\\nPage 13\\n \\nviewed it as consistent with helping offset the effects on \\naggregate demand of weak global growth and trade de-\\nvelopments, insuring against downside risks arising from \\nthose sources, and promoting a more rapid return of in-\\nflation to the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objec-\\ntive.  Two members preferred to maintain the current \\ntarget range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  \\nThese members indicated that the economic outlook re-\\nmained positive and that they anticipated, under an un-\\nchanged policy stance, continued strong labor market \\nconditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation \\ngradually moving up to the Committee\\u2019s 2 percent ob-\\njective.   \\nMembers agreed that, in determining the timing and size \\nof future adjustments to the target range for the federal \\nfunds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex-\\npected economic conditions relative to its maximum-\\nemployment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla-\\ntion objective.  They also agreed that those assessments \\nwould take into account a wide range of information, in-\\ncluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators \\nof inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and \\nreadings on financial and international developments. \\nWith regard to the postmeeting statement, members \\nagreed to update the language of the Committee\\u2019s de-\\nscription of incoming data to acknowledge that invest-\\nment spending and U.S. exports had remained weak.  In \\ndescribing the monetary policy outlook, they also agreed \\nto remove the \\u201cact as appropriate\\u201d language and empha-\\nsize that the Committee would continue to monitor the \\nimplications of incoming information for the economic \\noutlook as it assessed the appropriate path of the target \\nrange for the federal funds rate.  This change was seen \\nas consistent with the view that the current stance of \\nmonetary policy was likely to remain appropriate as long \\nas the economy performed broadly in line with the Com-\\nmittee\\u2019s expectations and that policy was not on a preset \\ncourse and could change if developments emerged that \\nled to a material reassessment of the economic outlook. \\nAt the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee \\nvoted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank \\nof New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute \\ntransactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol-\\nlowing domestic policy directive, to be released at \\n2:00 p.m.: \\n\\u201cEffective October 31, 2019, the Federal Open \\nMarket Committee directs the Desk to under-\\ntake open market operations as necessary to \\nmaintain the federal funds rate in a target range \\nof 1\\u00bd to 1\\u00be percent.  In light of recent and ex-\\npected increases in the Federal Reserve\\u2019s non-\\nreserve liabilities, the Committee directs the \\nDesk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the \\nsecond quarter of next year to maintain over \\ntime ample reserve balances at or above the \\nlevel that prevailed in early September 2019.  \\nThe Committee also directs the Desk to con-\\nduct term and overnight repurchase agreement \\noperations at least through January of next year \\nto ensure that the supply of reserves remains \\nample even during periods of sharp increases in \\nnon-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of \\nmoney market pressures that could adversely af-\\nfect policy implementation.  In addition, the \\nCommittee directs the Desk to conduct over-\\nnight reverse repurchase operations (and re-\\nverse repurchase operations with maturities of \\nmore than one day when necessary to accom-\\nmodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading \\nconventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, \\nin amounts limited only by the value of Treasury \\nsecurities held outright in the System Open \\nMarket Account that are available for such op-\\nerations and by a per-counterparty limit of \\n$30 billion per day. \\nThe Committee directs the Desk to continue \\nrolling over at auction all principal payments \\nfrom the Federal Reserve\\u2019s holdings of Treasury \\nsecurities and to continue reinvesting all princi-\\npal payments from the Federal Reserve\\u2019s hold-\\nings of agency debt and agency mortgage-\\nbacked securities received during each calendar \\nmonth.  Principal payments from agency debt \\nand agency mortgage-backed securities up to \\n$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-\\nvested in Treasury securities to roughly match \\nthe maturity composition of Treasury securities \\noutstanding; principal payments in excess of \\n$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-\\nvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  \\nSmall deviations from these amounts for oper-\\national reasons are acceptable. \\nThe Committee also directs the Desk to engage \\nin dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as \\nnecessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal \\nReserve\\u2019s agency mortgage-backed securities \\ntransactions.\\u201d \\nThe vote also encompassed approval of the statement \\nbelow to be released at 2:00 p.m.: \\nPage 14\\nFederal Open Market Committee\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n \\n\\u201cInformation received since the Federal Open \\nMarket Committee met in September indicates \\nthat the labor market remains strong and that \\neconomic activity has been rising at a moderate \\nrate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in \\nrecent months, and the unemployment rate has \\nremained low.  Although household spending \\nhas been rising at a strong pace, business fixed \\ninvestment and exports remain weak.  On a \\n12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation \\nfor items other than food and energy are run-\\nning below 2 percent.  Market-based measures \\nof inflation compensation remain low; survey-\\nbased measures of longer-term inflation expec-\\ntations are little changed. \\nConsistent with its statutory mandate, the Com-\\nmittee seeks to foster maximum employment \\nand price stability.  In light of the implications \\nof global developments for the economic out-\\nlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the \\nCommittee decided to lower the target range for \\nthe federal funds rate to 1\\u00bd to 1\\u00be percent.  \\nThis action supports the Committee\\u2019s view that \\nsustained expansion of economic activity, \\nstrong labor market conditions, and inflation \\nnear the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent ob-\\njective are the most likely outcomes, but uncer-\\ntainties about this outlook remain.  The Com-\\nmittee will continue to monitor the implications \\nof incoming information for the economic out-\\nlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the \\ntarget range for the federal funds rate. \\nIn determining the timing and size of future ad-\\njustments to the target range for the federal \\nfunds rate, the Committee will assess realized \\nand expected economic conditions relative to its \\nmaximum employment objective and its sym-\\nmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This as-\\nsessment will take into account a wide range of \\ninformation, including measures of labor mar-\\nket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures \\nand inflation expectations, and readings on fi-\\nnancial and international developments.\\u201d \\nVoting for this action:  Jerome H. Powell, John C. \\nWilliams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James \\nBullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, and \\nRandal K. Quarles. \\nVoting against this action:  Esther L. George and Eric \\nRosengren. \\nPresident George dissented at this meeting because she \\nbelieved that an unchanged setting of monetary policy \\nwas appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook \\nfor economic activity over the medium term.  Recogniz-\\ning risks to the outlook from the effects of trade devel-\\nopments and weaker global activity, President George \\nwould be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data \\npoint to a materially weaker outlook for the economy.  \\nPresident Rosengren dissented because he judged that \\nmonetary policy was already accommodative and that \\nadditional accommodation was not needed for an econ-\\nomy in which labor markets are very tight.  He judged \\nthat providing additional accommodation posed risks of \\nfurther inflating the prices of risky assets and encourag-\\ning households and firms to take on too much leverage. \\nConsistent with the Committee\\u2019s decision to lower the \\ntarget range for the federal funds rate to 1\\u00bd to 1\\u00be per-\\ncent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to \\nlower the interest rate paid on required and excess re-\\nserve balances to 1.55 percent and voted unanimously to \\napprove a \\u00bc percentage point decrease in the primary \\ncredit rate to 2.25 percent, effective October 31, 2019. \\nIt was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee \\nwould be held on Tuesday\\u2013Wednesday, December 10\\u2013\\n11, 2019.  The meeting adjourned at 9:50 a.m. on Octo-\\nber 30, 2019. \\nNotation Vote \\nBy notation vote completed on October 8, 2019, the \\nCommittee unanimously approved the minutes of the \\nCommittee meeting held on September 17\\u201318, 2019. \\nVideoconference meeting of October 4, 2019 \\nThe Committee met by videoconference on October 4, \\n2019, to review developments in money markets and to \\ndiscuss steps the Committee could take to facilitate effi-\\ncient and effective implementation of monetary policy.  \\nThe staff reviewed recent developments in money mar-\\nkets and the effect of the Desk\\u2019s continued offering of \\novernight and term repo operations.  Staff analysis and \\nmarket commentary suggested that many factors con-\\ntributed to the funding stresses that emerged in mid-Sep-\\ntember.  In particular, financial institutions\\u2019 internal risk \\nlimits and balance sheet costs may have slowed the dis-\\ntribution of liquidity across the system at a time when \\nreserves had dropped sharply and Treasury issuance was \\nelevated.  Although money market conditions had since \\nimproved, market participants expressed uncertainty \\nabout how funding market conditions may evolve over \\ncoming months, especially around year-end.  Further \\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\nMinutes of the Meeting of October 29\\u201330, 2019\\nPage 15\\n \\nout, the April 2020 tax season, with associated reduc-\\ntions in reserves around that time, was viewed as another \\npoint at which money market pressures could emerge.  \\nThe manager pro tem reviewed options that the Com-\\nmittee could consider to boost the level of reserves in \\nthe banking system and to address temporary money \\nmarket pressures that could adversely affect monetary \\npolicy implementation.  These options included a pro-\\ngram of Treasury bill purchases coupled with overnight \\nand term repo operations to maintain reserves at or \\nabove their early September level.   \\nDuring their discussion, all FOMC participants agreed \\nthat control over the federal funds rate was a priority and \\nthat recent money market developments suggested it \\nwas appropriate to consider steps at this time to maintain \\na level of reserves consistent with the Committee\\u2019s cho-\\nsen ample-reserves regime.  Given the projected decline \\nin reserves around year-end and in the spring of 2020, \\nthey judged that it was important to reach consensus \\nsoon on a near-term plan and associated communica-\\ntions.   \\nAll participants expressed support for a plan to purchase \\nTreasury bills into the second quarter of 2020 and to \\ncontinue conducting overnight and term repo opera-\\ntions at least through January of next year.  Many partic-\\nipants supported conducting operations to maintain re-\\nserve balances around the level that prevailed in early \\nSeptember.  Some others suggested moving to an even \\nhigher level of reserves to provide an extra buffer and \\ngreater assurance of control over the federal funds rate.  \\nIn discussing the pace of Treasury bill purchases, many \\nparticipants supported a relatively rapid pace to boost \\nreserve levels quickly, while others supported a more \\nmoderate pace of purchases.  Participants generally \\njudged that Treasury bill purchases and the associated \\nincrease in reserves would, over time, result in a gradual \\nreduction in the need for repo operations.  A few partic-\\nipants indicated that purchasing Treasury notes and \\nbonds with limited remaining maturities could also be \\nconsidered as a way to boost reserves, particularly if the \\nFederal Reserve faced constraints on the pace at which \\nit could purchase Treasury bills.  Participants generally \\nacknowledged some uncertainty over the efficient and \\neffective level of reserves and noted it would be prudent \\nto continue to monitor money market developments and \\nstand ready to adjust the plan as necessary.  Overall, par-\\nticipants agreed that the pace of purchases as well as the \\nparameters of the repo operations were technical details \\nof monetary policy implementation not intended to af-\\nfect the stance of monetary policy and should be com-\\nmunicated as such.   \\nMost participants preferred not to wait until the Octo-\\nber 29\\u201330 FOMC meeting to issue a public statement \\nregarding the planned Treasury bill purchases and repo \\noperations.  They noted that releasing a statement before \\nthe October 29\\u201330 FOMC meeting would help rein-\\nforce the point that these actions were technical and not \\nintended to affect the stance of policy.  In addition, a few \\nparticipants remarked that an earlier release would allow \\nthe Desk to begin boosting the level of reserves sooner.  \\nA couple of participants, however, wanted to wait until \\nthe October 29\\u201330 FOMC meeting to announce the \\nplan so as not to surprise market participants or lead \\nthem to infer that the Committee regarded the situation \\nas dire and thus requiring immediate action.  The Chair \\nproposed having the staff produce a draft statement that \\nthe Committee could comment on early in the following \\nweek.  Formal approval could occur by notation vote \\nwith an anticipated release of a statement to the public \\non October 11, 2019. \\nParticipants discussed longer-term issues that the Com-\\nmittee might want to study once the near-term plan was \\nin place.  In particular, many participants mentioned that \\nthe Committee may want to continue its previous dis-\\ncussion of a standing repo facility as a part of the long-\\nrun implementation framework.  Almost all of these par-\\nticipants noted that such a facility was an option to pro-\\nvide a backstop to buffer shocks that could adversely af-\\nfect policy implementation, and several of these partici-\\npants mentioned the potential for the facility to support \\nbanks\\u2019 liquidity risk management while reducing the de-\\nmand for reserves.  Other participants, instead, high-\\nlighted that policy implementation had worked well with \\nlarger quantities of reserves and focused their discussion \\non actions to firmly establish an ample supply of reserves \\nover the longer run. A number of participants noted that \\na discussion of a broader range of factors that affect the \\nlevel and volatility of reserves may be appropriate at a \\nfuture meeting. \\nOn October 11, 2019, the Committee approved by no-\\ntation vote the following statement that outlines steps to \\nensure that the supply of reserves remains ample so that \\ncontrol over the level of the federal funds rate and other \\nshort-term interest rates is exercised primarily through \\nthe setting of the Federal Reserve\\u2019s administered rates, \\nand in which active management of the supply of re-\\nserves is not required.  \\nPage 16\\nFederal Open Market Committee\\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\\n \\nSTATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY POL-\\nICY IMPLEMENTATION \\n(Adopted October 11, 2019) \\nConsistent with its January 2019 Statement Regarding \\nMonetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet \\nNormalization, the Committee reaffirms its intention to \\nimplement monetary policy in a regime in which an am-\\nple supply of reserves ensures that control over the level \\nof the federal funds rate and other short-term interest \\nrates is exercised primarily through the setting of the \\nFederal Reserve\\u2019s administered rates, and in which active \\nmanagement of the supply of reserves is not required.  \\nTo ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample, the \\nCommittee approved by notation vote completed on \\nOctober 11, 2019, the following steps: \\n\\u2022 \\nIn light of recent and expected increases in the Fed-\\neral Reserve\\u2019s non-reserve liabilities, the Federal Re-\\nserve will purchase Treasury bills at least into the \\nsecond quarter of next year in order to maintain \\nover time ample reserve balances at or above the \\nlevel that prevailed in early September 2019. \\n\\u2022 \\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve will conduct term \\nand overnight repurchase agreement operations at \\nleast through January of next year to ensure that the \\nsupply of reserves remains ample even during peri-\\nods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and \\nto mitigate the risk of money market pressures that \\ncould adversely affect policy implementation. \\nThese actions are purely technical measures to support \\nthe effective implementation of the FOMC\\u2019s monetary \\npolicy, and do not represent a change in the stance of \\nmonetary policy.  The Committee will continue to mon-\\nitor money market developments as it assesses the level \\nof reserves most consistent with efficient and effective \\npolicy implementation.  The Committee stands ready to \\nadjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster ef-\\nficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. \\nIn connection with these plans, the Federal Open \\nMarket Committee voted unanimously to authorize and \\ndirect the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until in-\\nstructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System \\nOpen Market Account in accordance with the following \\ndomestic policy directive: \\n\\u201cEffective October 15, 2019, the Federal Open \\nMarket Committee directs the Desk to under-\\ntake open market operations as necessary to \\nmaintain the federal funds rate in a target range \\nof 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  In light of recent and ex-\\npected increases in the Federal Reserve\\u2019s non-\\nreserve liabilities, the Committee directs the \\nDesk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the \\nsecond quarter of next year to maintain over \\ntime ample reserve balances at or above the \\nlevel that prevailed in early September 2019.   \\nThe Committee also directs the Desk to con-\\nduct term and overnight repurchase agreement \\noperations at least through January of next year \\nto ensure that the supply of reserves remains \\nample even during periods of sharp increases in \\nnon-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of \\nmoney market pressures that could adversely af-\\nfect policy implementation.  In addition, the \\nCommittee directs the Desk to conduct over-\\nnight reverse repurchase operations (and re-\\nverse repurchase operations with maturities of \\nmore than one day when necessary to accom-\\nmodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading \\nconventions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, \\nin amounts limited only by the value of Treasury \\nsecurities held outright in the System Open \\nMarket Account that are available for such op-\\nerations and by a per-counterparty limit of \\n$30 billion per day. \\nThe Committee directs the Desk to continue \\nrolling over at auction all principal payments \\nfrom the Federal Reserve\\u2019s holdings of Treasury \\nsecurities and to continue reinvesting all princi-\\npal payments from the Federal Reserve\\u2019s hold-\\nings of agency debt and agency mortgage-\\nbacked securities received during each calendar \\nmonth.  Principal payments from agency debt \\nand agency mortgage-backed securities up to \\n$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-\\nvested in Treasury securities to roughly match \\nthe maturity composition of Treasury securities \\noutstanding; principal payments in excess of \\n$20 billion per month will continue to be rein-\\nvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  \\nSmall deviations from these amounts for oper-\\national reasons are acceptable. \\nThe Committee also directs the Desk to engage \\nin dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as \\nnecessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal \\nReserve\\u2019s agency mortgage-backed securities \\ntransactions.\\u201d \\n \\n_______________________ \\nJames A.

The labor market has continued \\nto strengthen, with the unemployment rate staying low and payrolls expanding strongly. \\nReal GDP is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 3\\u00bd percent in the first half \\nof the year.  The staff continues to project above-trend GDP growth through 2019 and \\nhigh levels of resource utilization over the medium term.  Headline and core PCE prices \\nare estimated to have increased 2.2 and 1.9 percent, respectively, over the 12 months \\nthrough August.  The staff forecasts both headline and core PCE inflation to remain close \\nto 2 percent through 2021.  \\nThere are two key questions that the Committee is likely to face at this meeting:  \\nFirst, whether the available information warrants raising the target range for the federal \\nfunds rate; second, whether the federal funds rate path and the characterization of the \\nstance of monetary policy suggested by recent policy communications remain \\nappropriate, given the current economic outlook and associated risks.  The three \\nalternative draft statements have been prepared with these questions in mind. \\nUnder Alternative B, the Committee would raise the target range for the federal \\nfunds rate and reiterate its expectation that further gradual increases will be consistent \\nwith sustained economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent over \\nthe medium term.  Reflecting the increasing difficulty of making a definitive assessment \\nof the stance of monetary policy, Alternative B removes the language characterizing the \\nstance of monetary policy as \\u201caccommodative.\\u201d \\nAlternative C is written from the perspective that a steeper policy rate path than \\nthat signaled in Committee actions and communications over recent years will likely be \\nappropriate.  It registers some concern about potential overheating of the economy by \\nnoting that \\u201cthe Committee is closely monitoring the economic and financial implications \\nof high levels of resource utilization.\\u201d  Consequently, under Alternative C, the \\nCommittee not only raises the target range but also omits the indication that further rate \\nincreases are expected to be \\u201cgradual.\\u201d \\nAlternative A is motivated by the belief that the current stance of monetary policy \\nis at, or is very close to, neutral, a state in which policy is neither expansionary nor \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 1 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n   \\ncontractionary.  This alternative maintains the current target range for the federal funds \\nrate, no longer characterizes the stance of monetary policy as accommodative, and \\nremoves the reference to \\u201cfurther gradual increases.\\u201d  Such a statement would be \\nconsistent with either the end of\\u2014or a sustained pause in\\u2014the current tightening cycle.1  \\nWith regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A, B, and C: \\n\\uf0b7 The three alternatives have identical assessments of the incoming data; this \\ncharacterization is also the same as that in the August FOMC statement.  \\n\\uf0b7 With respect to the outlook for economic activity and inflation, the associated risks, \\nand the monetary policy path upon which the outlook is conditioned: \\no Alternative B projects \\u201csustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor \\nmarket conditions, and inflation near the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent \\nobjective over the medium term,\\u201d and notes that risks to this outlook are \\n\\u201croughly balanced.\\u201d  Alternative B conditions these outcomes on \\u201cfurther \\ngradual increases\\u201d in the federal funds rate. \\no Motivated by the risks posed by tight labor market conditions, Alternative C \\nsignals that a steeper trajectory for the federal funds rate \\u201cwill be warranted to \\nachieve a sustainable expansion of economic activity, maintain strong labor \\nmarket conditions, and keep inflation near the Committee\\u2019s symmetric \\n2 percent objective over the medium term.\\u201d  While continuing to describe the \\nrisks to the outlook as roughly balanced, Alternative C inserts a cautionary \\nnote that \\u201cthe Committee is closely monitoring the economic and financial \\nimplications of high levels of resource utilization.\\u201d \\no Alternative A conveys that the Committee expects that the federal funds rate \\nwill be unchanged in the near term, noting that the \\u201ccurrent target range,\\u201d \\nrather than \\u201cfurther gradual increases,\\u201d will support sustained economic \\nexpansion and inflation near the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objective.  \\n\\uf0b7 With respect to the current policy decision and the characterization of the stance of \\nmonetary policy: \\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n1 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in Alternative A as premature for use in \\npresent circumstances, but it might nonetheless consider such language for possible future use once the \\nCommittee judges that further increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are no longer \\nwarranted.   \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 2 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n   \\no Alternatives B and C raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to \\n2\\u00bc percent.  Alternative B no longer describes the stance of monetary policy \\nas accommodative and, consequently, also removes the rationale provided for \\nthis stance\\u2014supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return \\nto 2 percent inflation.  Alternative C retains the depiction of monetary policy \\nas remaining accommodative, but it removes the associated rationale, thus \\nconveying a message that maintaining an accommodative stance could soon \\nno longer be appropriate. \\no Alternative A maintains the target range for the federal funds rate at 1\\u00be to \\n2 percent.  The statement removes the description of the stance of monetary \\npolicy as remaining accommodative.  In combination with the removal of the \\nreference to \\u201cfurther gradual increases,\\u201d such a statement would signal that the \\nCommittee judges the existing stance of policy to be close enough to neutral \\nand that no further tightening is needed, or that a sustained pause in raising \\nrates is appropriate to guard against the risk of overtightening.  \\n\\u00a0\\n \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 3 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n   \\nAUGUST 2018 FOMC STATEMENT \\n1.

Total PCE inflation on a 12-month basis is projected to slow to \\n2 percent in September and to remain there through the end of the year; \\nthereafter, total PCE inflation is projected to run a bit below the core rate, but \\nstill close to 2 percent, as energy prices gradually decline. \\no Both market- and survey-based indicators of longer-term inflation \\nexpectations have moved little, on balance, since the July/August FOMC \\nmeeting; these measures continue to be consistent with the view that these \\nexpectations remain stable. \\n\\uf0b7 The staff estimates that output currently stands about 2\\u00bc percent above its potential \\nlevel and anticipates that the output gap will continue to widen, reaching more than \\n3 percent by the end of 2019.  In this projection, real GDP growth averages a bit more \\nthan 3 percent this year and then gradually slows to 1\\u00bd percent by 2021.  \\n\\uf0b7 Risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced.  Although weaker foreign growth and \\npotential trade policy developments could pose downside risks for economic activity, \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 8 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n   \\nit is also possible that fiscal policy will provide a stronger-than-expected boost to \\nGDP growth. \\nPolicy Strategy \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may judge that gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation \\nwill continue to be appropriate for some time in order to balance risks associated with \\noverly tight resource utilization against the risk of unduly slowing the economy, \\npotentially leading to below-target inflation.  \\no An increase in the target range in September would be seen as consistent with \\nthe Committee\\u2019s earlier statements indicating that further gradual adjustments \\nin the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate if the economy evolved \\nabout as anticipated. \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may expect that inflation will continue to run close to the Committee\\u2019s \\nsymmetric 2 percent inflation goal as further gradual tightening of monetary policy is \\ncarried out. \\no Policymakers may also view longer-term inflation expectations as consistent \\nwith achieving the Committee\\u2019s inflation objective. \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may no longer see it as appropriate to state that \\u201cthe stance of monetary \\npolicy remains accommodative.\\u201d  An increase in the target range would still leave the \\nfederal funds rate below the 2.8 to 3 percent central tendency for the longer-run level \\nof the federal funds rate in the June Summary of Economic Projections.  But due to \\nthe considerable uncertainty surrounding estimates of the neutral rate, it may become \\nincreasingly difficult to provide a reliable assessment of the stance of policy as the \\nfederal funds rate continues to rise.  Under these circumstances, maintaining a \\ndescription of the stance of policy as \\u201caccommodative\\u201d in the statement might convey \\na false sense of precision about the policy stance and the neutral level of the federal \\nfunds rate.  Communications challenges associated with this description of the policy \\nstance could increase over time.  \\n\\uf0b7 As discussed in the \\u201cMonetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty\\u201d box, financial \\nmarket quotes indicate that investors regard the odds of a rate hike at the upcoming \\nmeeting as extremely high.  Respondents to the Desk\\u2019s latest surveys of primary \\ndealers and market participants unanimously expect a rate hike at this meeting.  Thus, \\nan increase in the federal funds rate, by itself, would likely elicit little market \\nreaction.   \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 9 of

the stance of monetary policy as accommodative.  \\nThis change in the statement should not come as a complete surprise because \\nthe FOMC minutes released in August indicated that the Committee agreed \\nthat this language would \\u201cat some point fairly soon, no longer be appropriate.\\u201d  \\nIn the Desk\\u2019s surveys, roughly one-half of respondents did not explicitly \\nindicate

Other \\nindicators also point to an already-tight labor market; these include a record-\\nhigh job openings rate, continued reports of firms having difficulty hiring \\nworkers, and low levels of initial claims for unemployment insurance. \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may judge that the economy is stronger than previously expected.  \\nPayroll gains continue to indicate a tightening of the labor market, and\\u2014even after \\naccounting for factors that are expected to be transitory\\u2014the rebound of real GDP \\ngrowth in the second quarter appears to have been strong.  These developments may \\nsuggest that the neutral federal funds rate is higher, and the current monetary policy \\nstance is more accommodative, than previously estimated. \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may predict that unwanted upward pressure on inflation is likely to \\nemerge amid a prolonged period of significant labor market tightness.

In \\nparticular, the spreads between rates on certain investment- and speculative-grade \\ncorporate bonds and rates on equivalent-maturity Treasury securities have fallen \\nsubstantially over this period, while equity prices have increased sharply.  Moreover, \\nas discussed in the box \\u201cHow Have Business and Household Borrowing Conditions \\nChanged Over the Past Year?\\u201d in Tealbook A, while the federal funds rate and key \\ninterest rates for household and business borrowers have increased over the past year, \\nborrowing conditions have not exhibited a commensurate tightening, in part because \\nof an easing in nonprice credit terms and standards.   \\nPolicy Strategy \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may judge that a faster removal of policy accommodation than has been \\nsuggested by previous FOMC communications is necessary in the near term to avoid \\nsignificant overheating. \\no Policymakers may be concerned that ongoing above-trend economic growth \\nand an already-strong labor market that continues to tighten could soon result \\nin more notable upward pressure on inflation. \\no They may also judge that a steeper trajectory of rate hikes is needed to prevent \\nthe unemployment rate from declining significantly further below its normal \\nlonger-run value; such a further decline could make it increasingly \\nchallenging to engineer a soft landing as inflation picks up. \\no Additionally, amid elevated asset valuations and high levels of debt at risky \\nfirms, policymakers may see the need for a somewhat faster pace of rate \\nincreases to avoid a significant buildup of financial imbalances.  \\n\\uf0b7 For the above reasons, policymakers may opt to increase the target range for the \\nfederal funds rate to 2 to 2\\u00bc percent at this meeting and to omit statement language \\ncharacterizing the future pace of tightening as gradual. \\no In addition, while policymakers may still wish to characterize the stance of \\nmonetary policy as remaining accommodative, they may prefer not to describe \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 14 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n   \\nthe new level of the target range as \\u201csupporting strong labor market conditions \\nand a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.\\u201d  Removing this description \\nwould be intended to relay policymakers\\u2019 judgment that maintaining an \\naccommodative stance could soon no longer be appropriate. \\no Moreover, policymakers may wish to signal that the Committee now judges \\nthat a steeper path for the federal funds rate\\u2014steeper than suggested by the \\nCommittee\\u2019s previous communications\\u2014\\u201cwill be warranted to achieve a \\nsustainable expansion of economic activity, maintain strong labor market \\nconditions, and keep inflation near the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent \\nobjective over the medium term.\\u201d \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that \\u201cthe Committee is \\nclosely monitoring the economic and financial implications of high levels of resource \\nutilization,\\u201d signaling concern about the risks associated with overheating, including \\nthe possibility that a prolonged period of high resource utilization might cause a \\nsignificant buildup of financial imbalances. \\n\\uf0b7 The adoption of Alternative C would likely come as a surprise to market participants.  \\nMarket participants could read such a statement as indicating that the Committee \\nintends to raise the federal funds rate more rapidly than previously expected.  \\nMedium- and longer-term real interest rates could rise, as could the exchange value of \\nthe dollar; equity prices and inflation compensation could fall. \\nTHE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A \\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may see that inflation has moved close to 2 percent and that it is \\nprojected to remain close to that level on a sustained basis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Moreover, policymakers may view the labor market as operating close to or at full \\nemployment.  The unemployment rate is little changed since the start of the year; the \\nlabor force participation rate has stayed about the same, on balance, over the past four \\nyears.   \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may observe that, though real GDP is currently rising at a brisk pace, a \\ngradual slowing of growth is projected over the next few years, in part reflecting \\nwaning fiscal impetus. \\n \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 15 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n   \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers could judge that the current level of the federal funds rate lies within \\nthe confidence bands of a range of estimates of the neutral level for the federal funds \\nrate.  Furthermore, they may see developments in Treasury markets\\u2014particularly the \\nflattening yield curve\\u2014as supporting the view that current policy is close to neutral. \\nPolicy Strategy \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may assess that both objectives of the dual mandate are as close to \\nbeing fulfilled as in any time in recent memory.  They may consequently judge it \\nprudent to stop the gradual increases in the federal funds rate so as not to undermine \\nthe expansion of economic activity and the sustained return of inflation to 2 percent.3 \\no Policymakers may note that, while the expansion has been robust, the \\neconomy has shown few signs of overheating.  The labor market has \\nimproved at a remarkably steady pace over the past few years without \\ngenerating a large increase in either nominal wage growth or inflation.  \\nMoreover, inflation expectations have remained stable over this period.   \\no Policymakers may also view substantial risks associated with tightening too \\nquickly or too much.  Such policy actions could undermine the expansion or \\ncause inflation to run persistently below the Committee\\u2019s 2 percent objective.  \\nAn overly restrictive policy stance could be reflected in an inversion of the \\nyield curve, something that has in the past been associated with recessions.  \\nFurthermore, a slowdown in growth abroad or new trade policy developments \\ncould also restrain the economy over the near term.   \\no Finally, policymakers might note that monetary policy affects economic \\nactivity with a lag, and that the removal of accommodation that has taken \\nplace over the past few years will continue to act as a restraint on economic \\ngrowth for some time, mitigating the need for more increases in the target \\nrange federal funds rate at this stage. \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may continue to view the current state of the financial system as sound \\nand the potential for a buildup of risks to financial stability as limited, or they may \\njudge that interest rate policy is not an effective means of addressing any significant \\nfinancial stability concerns that may emerge. \\n\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n3  Conversely, policymakers might view the gradual removal of accommodation as still warranted \\nfor the time being, but might consider the language in Alternative A as a template for a future policy \\nstatement. \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 16 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n   \\n\\uf0b7 A statement along the lines of Alternative A would likely be regarded as an important \\nchange in the Committee\\u2019s policy outlook and would reduce expectations of rate \\nhikes in the near future.

As reported in the exhibit titled \\n\\u201cRedemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,\\u201d the staff projects that \\nthe balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017 will lead to the \\nredemption of $229 billion of Treasury securities and about $152 billion of agency \\nsecurities over 2018.1  During this same period, $197 billion of principal from maturing \\nTreasury securities and about $72 billion of principal from agency securities will be \\nreinvested.  Under the staff\\u2019s current baseline forecast of rising longer-term interest rates, \\nreinvestments of agency securities are projected to cease by October of this year, when \\nthe cap on monthly redemptions of agency securities rises to its $20 billion maximum.2 \\nHowever, the projections for agency securities are subject to considerable uncertainty \\nbecause unscheduled prepayments depend on factors that are difficult to predict, \\nincluding the realized path of mortgage rates.3 \\nEvolution of the size of the balance sheet.  One key assumption behind the \\nbalance sheet projection is that the longer-run level of reserve balances will be $500 \\nbillion.4  Using the baseline economic outlook in the September Tealbook, the projected \\n1 Projections include a preliminary estimate of September 2018 principal payments from agency \\nsecurities. \\n2 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasury securities has been fully \\nphased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury securities will take place primarily in the \\nmiddle month of each quarter.   \\n3 If actual principal payments were to breach the $20 billion cap before the size of the balance \\nsheet is normalized, then the Desk would reinvest in MBS the amount by which the principal payments \\nreceived during any month exceeds the cap.  For further details, see the FOMC memo titled \\u201cOperational \\nReadiness for MBS Reinvestments\\u201d (June 2018). \\n4 Other noteworthy assumptions about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  \\nThe Treasury General Account is assumed to increase in line with nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in \\ncirculation are assumed to increase at an average annual pace of about 6 percent through 2020 and at the \\nsame pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated \\nfinancial market utilities remain at their August 2018 levels of approximately $240 billion and $65 billion, \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 23 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 24 of 34\\n \\nRedemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments \\nProjections for Treasury Securities \\n(Billions of dollars) \\nRedemptions \\nReinvestments \\nSince \\nSince \\nPeriod \\nOct. 2017 \\nPeriod \\nOct. 2017 \\n2018: Q3 \\n67.0 \\n175.0 \\n27.4 \\n195.0 \\n2018: Q4 \\n72.1 \\n247.1 \\n29.3 \\n224.3 \\n2018 \\n229.1 \\n247.1 \\n197.2 \\n224.3 \\n2019 \\n270.8 \\n517.9 \\n114.2 \\n338.5 \\n2020 \\n210.5 \\n728.4 \\n82.1 \\n420.6 \\nProjections for Agency Securities \\n(Billions of dollars) \\nRedemptions \\nReinvestments \\nSince \\nPeriod \\nOct. 2017 \\nSince \\nPeriod \\nOct. 2017 \\n2018: Q3 \\n48.0 \\n120.0 \\n13.5 \\n132.5 \\n2018: Q4 \\n44.5 \\n164.2 \\n0.0 \\n132.5 \\n2018 \\n152.2 \\n164.5 \\n71.8 \\n132.5 \\n2019 \\n158.1 \\n322.6 \\n0.0 \\n132.5 \\n2020 \\n132.7 \\n455.3 \\n0.0 \\n132.5 \\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nredemption of securities from the Federal Reserve\\u2019s portfolio, as well as other \\nassumptions, this level of reserve balances will be reached in the second quarter of 2021, \\nunchanged from the July Tealbook projection (see the exhibit titled \\u201cTotal Assets and \\nSelected Balance Sheet Items\\u201d and the table that follows the exhibit).5 \\nFrom the start of the balance sheet reduction program in October 2017 to its \\nprojected conclusion in 2021, when the size of the balance sheet normalizes, the Federal \\nReserve\\u2019s securities holdings are predicted to decline about $1.3 trillion, with holdings of \\nTreasury and agency securities shrinking about $800 billion and $500 billion, \\nrespectively.  When the size of the balance sheet is normalized, the SOMA portfolio is \\nprojected to be just a touch less than $3 trillion, consisting of about $1.7 trillion in \\nTreasury securities and $1.3 trillion in agency securities.   \\nOnce the declines in asset holdings associated with normalization have taken \\nplace, the size of the balance sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal \\nGDP, compared with a peak of about 25 percent in 2014 and a pre-crisis average of about \\n6 percent.  After the size of the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will begin \\nto rise, keeping pace with the increases in Federal Reserve liabilities\\u2014including Federal \\nReserve notes in circulation and the Treasury General Account (TGA)\\u2014as well as \\nFederal Reserve Bank capital.  Expressed as shares of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve \\nassets and liabilities are expected to edge down. \\nFederal Reserve remittances.  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to \\ndecline to $62 billion this year from $80 billion in 2017 (see the \\u201cIncome Projections\\u201d \\nexhibit).6  This decline primarily reflects the realized and expected increases in the \\nrespectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility, which averaged under $2 billion in August 2018, is \\nassumed to be $0. \\n5 Many factors will influence the size of the balance sheet upon normalization, including banks\\u2019 \\npost-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally speaking, the size of the balance sheet is considered \\nto be normalized when the resumption of purchases of Treasury securities is required to satisfy demand for \\nreserve balances and accommodate the expansion of other key non-reserve liability items. \\n6 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory \\nlimit on aggregate Reserve Bank surplus.  First, $2.5 billion was transferred in February as a result of \\nSection 7 of the Federal Reserve Act being amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, enacted in \\nFebruary 2018.  Second, $675 million was transferred in June, reflecting Section 7 being amended by the \\nEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act enacted in May 2018. \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 25 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nSeptember Tealbook baseline\\nJuly Tealbook baseline\\nTotal Assets\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2020\\n2022\\n2024\\n2026\\n2028\\n2030\\n   0\\n 500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n2500\\n3000\\n3500\\n4000\\n4500\\n5000\\n5500\\nBillions of dollars\\nMonthly\\nReserve Balances\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2020\\n2022\\n2024\\n2026\\n2028\\n2030\\n0\\n 500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n2500\\n3000\\n3500\\nBillions of dollars\\nMonthly\\nSOMA Treasury Holdings\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2020\\n2022\\n2024\\n2026\\n2028\\n2030\\n   0\\n 500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n2500\\n3000\\n3500\\n4000\\nBillions of dollars\\nMonthly\\nSOMA Agency MBS Holdings\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2020\\n2022\\n2024\\n2026\\n2028\\n2030\\n   0\\n 200\\n 400\\n 600\\n 800\\n1000\\n1200\\n1400\\n1600\\n1800\\n2000\\n2200\\n2400\\nBillions of dollars\\nMonthly\\nTreasury Securities\\nAgency Securities\\nOther Assets\\nLoans\\nProjections\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n2006\\n2008\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2020\\n2022\\n2024\\n2026\\n2028\\n2030\\nPercent\\nAssets as a Share of GDP\\nFederal Reserve notes in circulation\\nTreasury General Account\\nOther Liabilities\\nTotal Reserves\\nProjections\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\n2006\\n2008\\n2010\\n2012\\n2014\\n2016\\n2018\\n2020\\n2022\\n2024\\n2026\\n2028\\n2030\\nPercent\\nLiabilities as a Share of GDP\\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\n\\u2022 \\u2022 \\u2022 \\nTotal Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items\\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 26 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nFederal Reserve Balance Sheet\\nEnd-of-Year Projections -- September Tealbook\\n(Billions of dollars) \\nAug 31, 2018 \\n2018 \\n2020 \\n2022 \\n2024 \\n2026 \\n2030 \\nTotal assets \\n4,207 \\n4,047 3,254 3,217 3,380 3,562 3,978 \\nSelected assets \\nLoans and other credit extensions* \\n2 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\nSecurities held outright \\n4,013 \\n3,872 3,106 3,087 3,264 3,458 3,892 \\nU.S. Treasury securities \\n2,313 \\n2,223 1,748 1,957 2,295 2,620 3,280 \\nAgency debt securities \\n2 \\n2 \\n2 \\n2 \\n2 \\n2 \\n2 \\nAgency mortgage-backed securities \\n1,697 \\n1,647 1,356 1,128 \\n966 \\n836 \\n610 \\nUnamortized premiums \\n146 \\n141 \\n111 \\n90 \\n75 \\n63 \\n43 \\nUnamortized discounts \\n-14 \\n-13 \\n-10 \\n-8 \\n-7 \\n-6 \\n-5 \\nTotal other assets \\n60 \\n47 \\n47 \\n47 \\n47 \\n47 \\n47 \\nTotal liabilities \\n4,168 \\n4,009 3,215 3,174 3,333 3,511 3,915 \\nSelected liabilities \\nFederal Reserve notes in circulation \\n1,638 \\n1,679 1,892 2,033 2,170 2,323 2,672 \\nReverse repurchase agreements \\n239 \\n240 \\n240 \\n240 \\n240 \\n240 \\n240 \\nDeposits with Federal Reserve Banks \\n2,286 \\n2,086 1,079 \\n897 \\n919 \\n944 \\n1000 \\nReserve balances held by depository \\n1,898 \\n1,737 \\n705 \\n500 \\n500 \\n500 \\n500 \\ninstitutions \\nU.S. Treasury, General Account \\n318 \\n279 \\n304 \\n327 \\n349 \\n373 \\n429 \\nOther deposits \\n70 \\n70 \\n70 \\n70 \\n70 \\n70 \\n70 \\nEarnings remittances due to the U.S. Treasury \\n1 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\n0 \\nTotal Federal Reserve Bank capital** \\n39 \\n39 \\n39 \\n43 \\n47 \\n52 \\n62 \\nSource: Federal Reserve H.4.1 statistical releases and staff calculations. \\nNote: Components may not sum to totals due to rounding. \\n*Loans and other credit extensions includes primary, secondary, and seasonal credit; central bank liquidity swaps; and net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLC. \\n**Total capital includes capital paid-in and capital surplus accounts. \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\n \\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 27 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\nIncome Projections\\n \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 28 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\ninterest rate paid on reserves in 2018.7  Total annual interest expense is projected to rise \\nby $16 billion to $46 billion this year, while interest income from SOMA holdings is \\nexpected to decline slightly, to $112 billion.  As the target range for the federal funds rate \\nmoves up and interest expense on reserve balances increases, remittances are expected to \\ndecline further and to bottom out at $33 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances increase \\ndue to a decrease in interest expense as the target range for the federal funds rate is \\nprojected to decline, and to the increase in interest income as the Desk resumes purchases \\nof Treasury securities for the SOMA portfolio. \\nThe projected path for remittances over the next few years is similar to that in the \\nJuly Tealbook.  As shown in the bottom left panel of the \\u201cIncome Projections\\u201d exhibit, \\nannual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP over the projection \\nperiod, slightly higher than their pre-crisis average. \\nUnrealized gains or losses.

With longer-term interest rates \\nexpected to rise further over the next several years, the unrealized loss position is \\nexpected to peak at $260 billion in 2020:Q3.  Of this amount, $105 billion is attributable \\nto Treasury securities and $155 billion to agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position \\nsubsequently narrows, in large part because the value of securities acquired under the \\nFederal Reserve\\u2019s large-scale asset purchase programs returns to par as those securities \\napproach maturity.

As shown in the top panel of the \\u201cProjections for the \\nCharacteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings\\u201d exhibit, the weighted-average \\nduration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is currently about six years.  This measure is \\nprojected to increase over the course of balance sheet size normalization, as the pace of \\nredemptions picks up and longer-duration securities become a larger share of the \\nportfolio.  In terms of the composition of the portfolio, the share of agency MBS is \\nexpected to peak at 44 percent shortly before the size of the balance sheet is expected to \\nbe normalized, reflecting the faster pace of roll-offs of Treasury securities, and then to \\ndecline to less than 30 percent at the end of 2024. \\nAfter normalization of the size of the balance sheet in 2021, the duration of the \\nSOMA Treasury portfolio is projected to decline as the Desk begins adding securities to \\nthe SOMA portfolio to keep pace with the expansion in non-reserve liabilities.  The \\ninitial sharp decline in duration results from the staff\\u2019s assumption that the Desk will \\npurchase only Treasury bills until these securities account for one-third of the Federal \\nReserve\\u2019s Treasury securities portfolio, close to their pre-crisis share.8  Thereafter, \\npurchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum \\n(see the bottom panel of the exhibit titled \\u201cProjections for the Characteristics of SOMA \\nTreasury Securities Holdings\\u201d).   \\n8 Currently, excluding small-value test operations, the SOMA portfolio contains no Treasury bills. \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 31 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\nProjections for the Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings  \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\n \\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 32 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nAbbreviations \\n \\n \\n \\nABS \\n \\nasset-backed securities \\nAFE \\n \\nadvanced foreign economy \\nBEA \\n \\nBureau of Economic Analysis, Department of Commerce  \\nBHC \\n \\nbank holding company \\nCDS \\n \\ncredit default swaps \\nCFTC  \\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission  \\nC&I \\n \\ncommercial and industrial \\nCLO \\n \\ncollateralized loan obligation \\nCMBS  \\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities  \\nCPI \\n \\nconsumer price index \\nCRE \\n \\ncommercial real estate \\nDEDO  \\nsection in Tealbook A: \\u201cDomestic Economic Developments and Outlook\\u201d  \\nDesk \\n \\nOpen Market Desk \\nDFMU  \\nDesignated Financial Market Utilities \\n \\nECB \\n \\nEuropean Central Bank \\nELB \\n \\neffective lower bound \\nEME \\n \\nemerging market economy \\nEU \\n \\nEuropean Union \\nFAST Act \\nFixing America\\u2019s Surface Transportation Act  \\nFDIC \\n \\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation \\nFOMC  \\nFederal Open Market Committee; also, the Committee  \\nGCF \\n \\ngeneral collateral finance \\nGDI \\n \\ngross domestic income \\nGDP \\n \\ngross domestic product \\nGSIBs  \\nglobally systemically important banking organizations  \\nHQLA  \\nhigh-quality liquid assets \\nIOER \\n \\ninterest on excess reserves \\nISM \\n \\nInstitute for Supply Management  \\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 33 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nLIBOR  \\nLondon interbank offered rate \\nLSAPs  \\nlarge-scale asset purchases  \\nMBS \\n \\nmortgage-backed securities \\nMMFs  \\nmoney market funds \\nNBER  \\nNational Bureau of Economic Research  \\nNI \\n \\nnominal income \\nNIPA \\n \\nnational income and product accounts  \\nOIS \\n \\novernight index swap \\nON RRP \\novernight reverse repurchase agreement  \\nPCE \\n \\npersonal consumption expenditures \\nQS \\n \\nQuantitative Surveillance \\nrepo \\n \\nrepurchase agreement \\nRMBS  \\nresidential mortgage-backed securities  \\nRRP \\n \\nreverse repurchase agreement \\nSCOOS  \\nSenior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms  \\nSEP \\n \\nSummary of Economic Projections \\nSFA \\n \\nSupplemental Financing Account \\nSLOOS  \\nSenior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  \\nSOMA  \\nSystem Open Market Account \\nTBA \\n \\nto be announced (for example, TBA market)  \\nTCJA \\n \\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 \\nTGA \\n \\nU.S. Treasury\\u2019s General Account \\nTIPS \\n \\nTreasury inflation-protected securities  \\nTPE \\n \\nTerm premium effects \\nZLB \\n \\nzero lower bound \\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nSeptember 20, 2018\\nPage 34 of 34\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n\",\n          \"Content last modified 1/12/2024. \\n \\nPrefatory Note \\n \\n \\nThe attached document represents the most complete and accurate version available \\nbased on original files from the FOMC Secretariat at the Board of Governors of the \\nFederal Reserve System.   \\n \\nPlease note that some material may have been redacted from this document if that \\nmaterial was received on a confidential basis.

On balance, the available \\nindicators suggest that the labor market continued to strengthen in the first quarter.  The \\nstaff estimates that the 12-month change in headline and core PCE prices stepped up to \\n2.1 and 1.9 percent, respectively, in March, a touch higher than was anticipated at the \\nMarch meeting.  The softness in real GDP growth in the first quarter appears to have \\nbeen largely transitory, and the staff continues to project above-trend growth and high \\nlevels of resource utilization over the medium term.1 \\nThere are three key questions for the Committee at this meeting.  The first is \\nwhether the available information warrants raising the target range for the federal funds \\nrate.  The second is whether the economic outlook and associated risks indicate that the \\nfederal funds rate path suggested by recent FOMC communications remains appropriate.  \\nThe third question is whether, in light of the evolution of the economic outlook and \\nbalance of risks over the past few quarters, some parts of the FOMC statement need to be \\nupdated to more clearly express the Committee\\u2019s expectations and intentions.  With these \\nissues in mind, three alternative draft statements are proposed below. \\nAlternative B characterizes the labor market and spending data similarly to the \\nMarch statement and notes that both total and core measures of 12-month inflation have \\nmoved close to 2 percent.  It maintains the current target range for the federal funds rate \\nand updates the inflation outlook in light of the anticipated increase in both measures.  In \\naddition, consistent with the update to the inflation language as well as the March \\nSummary of Economic Projections (SEP), in which no participant saw risks to the \\noutlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, the balance of risks statement has been \\nsimplified to state: \\u201cRisks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.\\u201d \\nAlternative A is motivated by the view that, although headline inflation has \\nrecently moved close to the Committee\\u2019s 2 percent objective, the level of longer-run \\ninflation expectations might still be too low.  It articulates an outlook in which inflation \\nmodestly exceeds 2 percent for a time, conditioned on \\u201cappropriate monetary policy \\n1 The BEA\\u2019s first estimate of GDP for 2018:Q1 will be released on April 27.  PCE inflation data \\nfor March will be available on April 30; the staff\\u2019s current estimate is based on CPI and PPI data through \\nMarch. \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 1 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n \\naccommodation\\u201d rather than on further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  This \\nalternative maintains the current target range for the federal funds rate and removes the \\ncurrent forward guidance language on the grounds that further rate hikes may not be \\nnecessary and that a period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be helpful in \\ngetting longer-run inflation expectations up to a level consistent with sustained 2 percent \\ninflation over the medium run. \\nAlternative C can be viewed in two different ways.  By expressing the view that \\neconomic conditions and the outlook warrant an immediate hike in the federal funds rate, \\nAlternative C can be seen as the less accommodative counterpart to Alternative B.  If the \\nCommittee were to increase the federal funds rate at this meeting, that step would likely \\nbe taken as a signal that the Committee will pursue a higher path for the federal funds \\nrate than market participants had been expecting.  Alternatively, this draft statement \\ncould serve as a potential template for the statement that the Committee might release in \\nJune if the economy continues to develop roughly as expected.  Many FOMC participants \\nhave said they see a need to update parts of the policy statement in light of the evolving \\nstate of the economy and stance of monetary policy, and Alternative C has been written \\nwith this in mind.  To facilitate consideration of Alternative C as a possible template for \\nJune, this document includes a brief discussion of how the language in Alternative C \\nmight be viewed if the Committee adopts Alternative B at the May meeting and if the \\neconomy subsequently evolves roughly as expected (see pages 16 and 17). \\nWith regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A, B, and C: \\n\\uf0b7 Each alternative removes the statement that \\u201cthe economic outlook has strengthened \\nin recent months.\\u201d  This text reflected an improved outlook at the March meeting; \\nremoving it indicates that the outlook has not strengthened further since March. \\n\\uf0b7 The three alternatives are nearly identical in their assessment of the strength of \\nincoming real-side data, and they all note that inflation has \\u201cmoved close to 2 \\npercent,\\u201d while Alternative A adds that this has occurred \\u201crecently.\\u201d  The alternatives \\ndiffer slightly with regard to inflation expectations: \\no Alternative C combines both market-based measures of inflation \\ncompensation and survey-based measures of inflation expectations into the \\nbroader category \\u201cindicators of longer-term inflation expectations.\\u201d  These \\nindicators are little changed, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 2 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n \\no Alternatives A and B describe these two measures separately, noting that \\nmeasures of inflation compensation remain low. \\n\\uf0b7 Although the three statements project roughly similar outcomes for economic activity \\nand the labor market, they differ in their descriptions of the inflation outlook and the \\nmonetary policy upon which the outlook is conditioned: \\no Alternative B states that inflation, having moved close to 2 percent, is \\nexpected to \\u201crun near the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 percent objective\\u201d and \\ncontinues to condition the outlook on \\u201cfurther gradual adjustments in stance of \\nmonetary policy.\\u201d  \\no Alternative C similarly modifies the inflation outlook, but states the \\nCommittee\\u2019s expectation that \\u201cfurther gradual increases in the target range for \\nthe federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic \\nactivity and employment and with inflation near the Committee\\u2019s symmetric 2 \\npercent objective over the medium term.\\u201d  In addition, Alternative C removes \\nfrom paragraph 4 the language about carefully monitoring actual and expected \\ninflation.  Dropping this language may be taken as a signal that the Committee \\ncurrently see the risks to inflation as more evenly balanced. \\no Alternative A projects inflation to modestly exceed 2 percent for a time and \\nthen run near the Committee\\u2019s objective, and notes that \\u201cthis inflation \\noutcome should help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations rise to a \\nlevel consistent with the Committee\\u2019s symmetric objective for 2 percent \\ninflation.\\u201d  The outlook under Alternative A is conditioned on \\u201cappropriate \\nmonetary policy accommodation\\u201d rather than further gradual increases in the \\nfederal funds rate.   \\n\\uf0b7 Following the update to the inflation outlook under both alternatives, the balance of \\nrisks in Alternatives B and C is changed to state that \\u201crisks to the economic outlook \\nappear roughly balanced.\\u201d  The balance of risks given in Alternative A is unchanged \\nfrom the March statement, retaining the statement that the Committee is monitoring \\ninflation developments closely. \\n\\uf0b7 With respect to the current policy decision: \\no Alternatives A and B leave the target range unchanged at 1\\u00bd to 1\\u00be percent. \\no Alternative C raises the target range to 1\\u00be to 2 percent but continues to note \\nthat the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 3 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n \\n\\uf0b7 With respect to the forward guidance language: \\no Alternative B retains the forward guidance language at the end of paragraph 4; \\nAlternatives A and C delete it.   \\no In light of the changes in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Alternative A, dropping the \\nfinal two sentences from paragraph 4 of Alternative A likely would be read as \\na signal that the Committee is in no hurry to raise the federal funds rate \\nfurther.   \\no In contrast, adopting Alternative C at this meeting likely would be taken as a \\nsignal that the Committee now sees a need to raise the federal funds rate \\nsomewhat more rapidly than previously anticipated\\u2014though still gradually, \\nprimarily because the timing of the rate increase would come as a surprise.  \\nAlternatively, if adopted in June, a statement along the lines of Alternative C \\nwould likely not change market perceptions of the potential pace of rate hikes.  \\nAs the Committee\\u2019s expectation for further gradual rate increases has been \\nmoved into paragraph 2, dropping the same thought from paragraph 4 should \\nnot, by itself, alter the expected path for policy.  However, eliminating the \\nclause that the federal funds rate is expected to remain below its longer-run \\nlevel could increase expectations that the federal funds rate may move to, or \\npossibly above, its estimated longer-run value in the not too distant future. \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 4 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n \\nMARCH 2018 FOMC STATEMENT \\n1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January \\nindicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic \\nactivity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been strong in recent \\nmonths, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Recent data suggest that \\ngrowth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have \\nmoderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings.  On a 12-month basis, both \\noverall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued \\nto run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have \\nincreased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term \\ninflation expectations are little changed, on balance. \\n \\n2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum \\nemployment and price stability.  The economic outlook has strengthened in recent \\nmonths.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the \\nstance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in \\nthe medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a \\n12-month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around \\nthe Committee\\u2019s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to \\nthe economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring \\ninflation developments closely. \\n \\n3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the \\nCommittee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to \\n1-3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby \\nsupporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent \\ninflation. \\n \\n4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the \\nfederal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic \\nconditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent \\ninflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, \\nincluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures \\nand inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international \\ndevelopments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected \\ninflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee \\nexpects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further \\ngradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to \\nremain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  \\nHowever, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic \\noutlook as informed by incoming data. \\n \\n \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 5 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   [Note: In the 2018 April FOMC Statement alternatives, curly braces { } have been added to indicate differing text and square brackets [ ] have been added to indicate strikethrough text from the 2018 March FOMC Statement.\\n \\nALTERNATIVE A FOR MAY 2018 \\n1.

The current rate of job growth is well above the pace consistent with an \\nunchanged unemployment rate if the labor force participation rate were declining in \\nline with its estimated trend.  However, the participation rate has held roughly steady \\nfor the past several years and is projected to continue to do so over the next few years.  \\nThe wage data that have arrived since the March meeting remain consistent with the \\npicture of moderate wage gains overall.2 \\n\\uf0b7 Recent data show that inflation has moved close to the Committee\\u2019s 2 percent goal.  \\nThe staff projects that inflation will remain near 2 percent in the medium term. \\no Over the 12 months ending in March, the estimated core PCE inflation rate was \\n1.9 percent while total PCE inflation was 2.1 percent.  Both of these estimates are \\nslightly above the staff\\u2019s projection in March and reflect the extraordinarily low \\nreading from March of last year dropping out of the calculation. \\no The staff projection of core PCE inflation on a 12-month basis rises to 2.0 percent \\nin May and averages 2.1 percent in the third quarter, while the projection for total \\nPCE inflation on a 12-month basis is 2.5 percent at the end of the second quarter \\nand 2.2 percent at the conclusion of the third quarter, slowing to about 2 percent \\nafterward as the effects of recent energy price increases wane. \\no The staff projects that total and core PCE inflation will remain close to 2 percent \\nthrough 2020.   \\no Both market- and survey-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations \\nhave moved little, on balance, since the March Tealbook, and are consistent with \\nthe view that these expectations remain stable. \\n\\uf0b7 Real GDP growth is projected to average 2\\u00bc percent at an annual rate over the first \\nhalf of the year, a little less than projected in the March Tealbook but still higher than \\nits trend pace.

Given that monetary policy operates with a lag, and \\nfollowing two policy rate increases in the past three meetings, policymakers may see \\nthe language in Alternative B as signaling that the strength in the economy continues \\nto call for further gradual increases in the target range but not for an adjustment to the \\nstance of monetary policy at the May meeting. \\no A gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation may continue to be \\nseen as appropriate to balance the risk of the labor market becoming unduly \\noverheated against the risk of inflation failing to return to 2 percent on a \\nsustained basis.  \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may see recent inflation developments as consistent with the view that \\ninflation expectations are well anchored and that the idiosyncratic factors that held \\ndown inflation last year were indeed transitory.  If so, they may wish to update the \\noutlook for inflation by stating that inflation will \\u201crun near the Committee\\u2019s \\nsymmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.\\u201d  \\n\\uf0b7 With above-trend growth, positive impetus from fiscal policy, solid growth abroad, \\ncontinued strengthening of the labor market, and inflation close to their objective, \\npolicymakers may perceive that\\u2014conditional on further gradual increases in the \\nfederal funds rate\\u2014the risks to the outlook for both employment and inflation are \\nroughly balanced.  If so, they may wish to remove the emphasis on monitoring \\ninflation from their discussion of the balance of risks.   \\n\\uf0b7 As shown in the \\u201cMonetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty\\u201d box, financial \\nmarket quotes indicate that market participants regard the odds of a rate hike at the \\nupcoming meeting as negligible but see a high probability that the federal funds rate \\nwill be raised at the June meeting.

change in asset prices.  \\nTHE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C \\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is operating appreciably beyond full \\nemployment and that economic activity\\u2014which was already expanding at a faster-\\nthan-sustainable rate\\u2014will continue to be spurred by the tax cuts and spending \\nlegislation enacted over the last two quarters. \\no The unemployment rate remains below each FOMC participant\\u2019s estimate of \\nits longer-run normal level and the staff projects it will decline further.  Other \\nindicators also point to an already tight labor market\\u2014including a near-record \\nhigh job openings rate in February, continued widespread reports of firms \\nhaving difficulty hiring workers, and near-record-low initial claims for \\nunemployment insurance.   \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may believe that more concerted upward pressure on both wages and \\nprices is likely to emerge if the economy undergoes a prolonged period of significant \\nlabor market tightness.  If so, they may project that inflation will soon move \\npersistently above the Committee\\u2019s 2 percent objective.   \\n\\uf0b7 Despite six increases in the target range for the federal funds rate between December \\n2015 and March 2018 and some recent financial market volatility, financial \\nconditions have eased on net since the Committee first raised the target range for the \\nfederal funds rate.  On net, broad equity price indexes have increased roughly 30 \\npercent and spreads of investment- and speculative grade corporate bonds to \\nequivalent maturity Treasury securities have declined around 80 and 200 basis points, \\nrespectively, since liftoff.   \\no Risk spreads on speculative grade debt narrowed even as use of leverage by \\nspeculative grade and unrated firms has increased, on balance, over the past \\nseveral years.  \\nPolicy Strategy \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may judge that a somewhat faster removal of policy accommodation \\nthan market participants currently expect will be needed to avoid severe overheating \\nand an eventual need to tighten policy abruptly.  An increase in the target range for \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 15 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n \\nthe federal funds rate at the May meeting would signal the Committee\\u2019s intention to \\npursue a steeper path for the policy rate than is currently expected.  \\no Policymakers may be concerned that above-trend economic growth and an \\nalready-strong labor market that continues to tighten could soon result in more \\nnotable upward pressures on inflation.   \\no They may also judge that a somewhat faster pace of rate hikes is needed to \\nprevent the unemployment rate from declining significantly further below its \\nnormal longer-run value; such a further decline could be seen as making the \\nchallenge of engineering a soft landing in the labor market as inflation picks \\nup increasingly difficult.  \\no Additionally, amid elevated asset valuations and an increased use of debt by \\nnonfinancial corporations, policymakers may see a somewhat faster pace of \\nrate increases as needed to avoid a significant buildup of imbalances in \\nfinancial markets.   \\n\\uf0b7 For the above reasons, policymakers may opt to raise the target range of the federal \\nfunds rate to 1\\u00be to 2 percent.   \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers might also want to update the statement along the lines of Alternative C \\nso that it reflects more clearly the Committee\\u2019s current expectations for inflation and \\nthe federal funds rate. \\no The Committee may choose to remove the language about carefully \\nmonitoring actual and expected inflation from paragraph 4.  Dropping this \\nlanguage may be taken as a signal that the Committee currently see the risks \\nto inflation as more evenly balanced.   \\no In light of the expected path for the policy rate, the Committee may want to \\ndelete the statement that \\u201cthe federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some \\ntime, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run\\u201d and to \\nconclude with a simpler statement of data dependency regarding the timing \\nand size of future adjustments to the target range.   \\n\\uf0b7 Federal funds futures quotes and the Desk\\u2019s latest surveys indicate that market \\nparticipants anticipate no change in the target range at the May meeting.  \\nConsequently, adopting Alternative C likely would surprise market participants \\nconsiderably.   \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 16 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n \\no Market participants might well read such a statement, if issued in May when \\nno rate hike is expected, as indicating the Committee\\u2019s intention to raise the \\nfederal funds rate more rapidly than previously expected.  Medium- and \\nlonger-term real interest rates would likely rise, as would the exchange value \\nof the dollar; equity prices and inflation compensation would probably fall. \\nTHE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A \\nEconomic Conditions and Outlook \\n\\uf0b7 On a 12-month basis, core PCE inflation is estimated to have moved to 1.9 percent in \\nMarch, just below the 2 percent objective.  However, the staff\\u2019s estimate of 12-month \\ncore PCE inflation including only market-based prices for March is only 1.6 percent \\neven after the extraordinarily low reading from last March dropped out of the \\ncalculation.  Policymakers may judge that inflation will continue to be held down by \\npersistent factors.  \\n\\uf0b7 One factor holding down both core and total inflation may be low expected inflation.  \\nReadings on market-based measures of inflation compensation remain substantially \\nbelow where they were before the middle of 2014, and some survey-based measures \\nof longer-term inflation expectations are still low by historical standards.  \\n\\uf0b7 Moreover, the labor market may not yet have reached maximum sustainable \\nemployment and may have further room for improvement.  While job gains have been \\nsolid, the unemployment rate has been unchanged over the past six months and wages \\nhave shown little sign of accelerating.  The employment-to-population ratio for \\nprime-age workers has been rising but still remains below its pre-recession level, \\nsuggesting scope for further labor market strengthening.  In addition, the behavior of \\nthe labor force participation rate over the past four years suggests that its trend may \\nnot be declining as fast as previously estimated. \\nPolicy Strategy \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may be concerned that longer-term inflation expectations have declined \\nmaterially in recent years and could drift down further if inflation continues to run \\nbelow 2 percent.  Policymakers may further judge that removing the statement\\u2019s \\nemphasis on monitoring inflation as soon as the rate nears 2 percent runs the risk of \\ncreating the perception that the Committee sees its longer-run objective as a ceiling \\nrather than as a symmetric objective.  \\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 17 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   \\n \\no Against that background, policymakers may favor Alternative A in order to \\nunderscore the Committee\\u2019s commitment to its inflation objective and to \\nensure that longer term inflation expectations are anchored at a level close to \\nthe Committee\\u2019s 2 percent objective.  In addition, policymakers may judge \\nthat the past decade\\u2019s experience of low inflation reduces the likelihood that \\ninflation expectations will rise significantly above 2 percent.   \\n\\uf0b7 Policymakers may view the current state of the financial system as sound, the \\npotential for a buildup of risks to financial stability as limited, and may judge that \\nthere is scope to address any emerging financial stability concerns through \\nmacroprudential policies and supervisory actions that target specific risks.   \\n\\uf0b7 Despite the likely stimulative effects of the changes in federal taxes and spending \\nenacted over the past two quarters, other policies\\u2014particularly trade policies\\u2014pose \\ndownside risks.  Policymakers may judge that their ability to react to downside \\noutcomes remains limited by proximity of the federal funds rate to the effective lower \\nbound. \\n\\uf0b7 While financial market quotes and the Desk\\u2019s latest surveys indicate that market \\nparticipants anticipate no change in the target range at the May meeting, they view an \\nincrease at the June meeting as highly likely.  Thus, a statement along the lines of \\nAlternative A would likely be regarded as an important change in the Committee\\u2019s \\npolicy outlook and reduce expectations of further rate hikes.  If the public saw this \\nstatement as primarily reflecting policymakers\\u2019 resolve to push inflation above 2 \\npercent for a time, then inflation compensation could rise, real longer-term interest \\nrates would probably fall somewhat, and equity prices might rise.  Lower real rates \\nand the prospect of higher inflation likely would lead to depreciation of the dollar.  \\nConversely, if investors read the statement as reflecting an unexpectedly downbeat \\nassessment of the economic outlook, equity prices and inflation compensation could \\nfall.  \\n\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nAlternatives\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 18 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n   [Note: In the 2018 April FOMC Statement alternatives, curly braces { } have been added to indicate differing text and square brackets [ ] have been added to indicate strikethrough text from the 2018 March FOMC Statement.\\n \\nILLUSTRATIVE DRAFT OF A POTENTIAL STATEMENT FOR JUNE 2018  \\nAs noted above, Alternative C has been written with the aim of looking forward \\nto how the FOMC statement might appear in June.

During this \\nsame period, about $200 billion of Treasury securities and about $65 billion of agency \\nsecurities will be reinvested.1  The projections for agency securities are subject to \\nconsiderable uncertainty because unscheduled prepayments depend on several factors \\nthat are difficult to predict, including the realized path of mortgage rates.  (See the box \\n\\u201cMBS Reinvestment Uncertainty\\u201d for additional discussion of MBS prepayments.) \\nEvolution of the size of the balance sheet.  Based on the baseline economic \\noutlook in the April Tealbook, the size of the balance sheet is projected to normalize in \\nthe third quarter of 2021, unchanged from the March Tealbook (see the exhibit titled \\n\\u201cTotal Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items\\u201d and the table that follows the exhibit).2   \\nFrom the start of the balance sheet normalization program in October 2017 to its \\nprojected conclusion in 2021, the Federal Reserve\\u2019s securities holdings are predicted to \\n1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasury securities has been fully \\nphased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury securities will primarily take place in the \\nmiddle month of each quarter.  In contrast, under the staff\\u2019s current baseline forecast of rising longer-term \\ninterest rates, the maximum $20 billion cap on monthly redemptions of agency securities is not projected to \\nbind. \\n2 Many factors will influence the size of the balance sheet upon normalization, including banks\\u2019 \\npost-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally speaking, the size of the balance sheet is considered \\nto be normalized when the resumption of purchases of Treasury securities is required to maintain the \\ndesired longer-run level of reserve balances and accommodate the expansion of other key non-reserve \\nliability items. \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 27 of

At the time of normalization: \\n\\uf0b7\\nReserve balances reach an assumed longer-run level of $500 billion;3\\n\\uf0b7\\nTotal assets are projected to stand at roughly $3 trillion, with the SOMA portfolio\\nconsisting of about $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities and $1.3 trillion in MBS.\\nOnce these declines in asset holdings have taken place, the size of the balance\\nsheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal GDP, compared with a peak \\nof about 25 percent in late 2014 and a pre-crisis average of about 6 percent.  After the \\nsize of the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings rise, keeping pace with the \\nprojected increases in Federal Reserve liabilities including Federal Reserve notes in \\ncirculation, the Treasury General Account (TGA), and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  \\nHowever, when expressed as a share of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve assets and \\nliabilities are projected to edge down, as their pace of expansion is projected to be \\nslightly slower than that of nominal GDP. \\nFederal Reserve remittances.  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to \\ndecline to about $57 billion this year (including the transfer of $2.5 billion of surplus) \\nfrom $80 billion in 2017, (see the \\u201cIncome Projections\\u201d exhibit).4  This decline primarily \\nreflects the realized and expected increases in the interest rate paid on reserves in 2018.5  \\nTotal interest expense is projected to rise to $50 billion this year, while interest income \\nfrom SOMA holdings is expected to decline slightly to $110 billion.  As the target range \\nfor the federal funds rate moves up and the size of the SOMA portfolio decreases, \\nremittances are expected to bottom out at about $33 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, \\n3 Other noteworthy assumptions about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  \\nThe Treasury General Account is assumed to increase in line with nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in \\ncirculation are assumed to increase at an average annual pace of about 6 percent through 2020 and at the \\nsame pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated \\nfinancial market utilities remain at their March 2018 levels of about $230 billion and $75 billion, \\nrespectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to maintain a value of $100 billion until \\nthe level of reserve balances reaches $1 trillion, at which point take-up declines to zero over the course of \\none year. \\n4 The Federal Reserve Board\\u2019s public announcement of remittances to the Treasury for 2017 is \\navailable at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20180110a.htm. \\n5 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25 basis-point-wide target range for the federal \\nfunds rate throughout the projection period, and that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances and \\nthe offering rate on overnight RRPs will continue to be set at the top and bottom of the range, respectively. \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 33 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n  \\n \\n      \\n                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n      \\n                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n      \\n                          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n                        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\nIncome Projections\\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 34 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nremittances begin to increase as the Desk begins adding higher-yielding Treasury \\nsecurities to the SOMA portfolio. \\nThe projected path for remittances over the next few years is similar to that \\nimplied by the March Tealbook baseline.  As shown in the bottom left panel of the \\n\\u201cIncome Projections\\u201d exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal \\nGDP over the projection period, slightly higher than their pre-crisis average. \\nUnrealized gains or losses.  The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio will be \\nin a net unrealized loss position of about $20 billion at the end of April.  With longer-\\nterm interest rates expected to rise further over the next several years, the unrealized loss \\nposition is expected to reach $270 billion in 2020:Q2.  Of this amount, $110 billion is \\nattributable to Treasury securities and $160 billion to agency MBS.  The unrealized loss \\nposition subsequently narrows, in large part because the value of securities acquired \\nunder the Federal Reserve\\u2019s large-scale asset purchase programs returns to par as those \\nsecurities approach maturity.  Relative to the March Tealbook, the net unrealized position \\nis projected to be, on average, about $15 billion less negative over the projection horizon, \\nreflecting the lower trajectories of medium- and longer-term interest rates.   \\nTerm premium effect.  As shown in the table \\u201cProjections for the 10-Year \\nTreasury Term Premium Effect,\\u201d SOMA securities held as a result of the Federal \\nReserve\\u2019s asset purchase programs are currently estimated to be reducing the term \\npremium in the 10-year Treasury yield by 82 basis points; this effect is projected to fade \\ngradually over time.6  This projection is little changed from the previous Tealbook. \\nSOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of the \\u201cProjections for the \\nCharacteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings\\u201d exhibit, the weighted-average \\nduration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is currently about six years.  This measure is \\nprojected to increase throughout the course of balance sheet normalization, as the pace of \\nredemptions picks up and longer-duration securities become a larger share of the \\nportfolio.  \\nAfter normalization of the size of the balance sheet in 2021, the duration of the \\nSOMA Treasury portfolio is projected to decline as the Desk begins adding to the SOMA \\n6 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the difference between the expected \\npath of the Federal Reserve\\u2019s balance sheet over coming years and a benchmark counterfactual projection \\nbased on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007\\uf02d2008.   \\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 35 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nProjections  fo r t he 10-Y ear Trea sury  Term P remium  \\nEffect  \\u0003(Basis Points)\\nDate\\nApril\\n Tealbook\\nMarch\\n Tealbook\\nQuarterly  Averages\\n2018:Q2\\n-82\\n-83\\nQ3\\n-79\\n-80\\nQ4\\n-76\\n-77\\n2019:Q4\\n-66\\n-66\\n2020:Q4\\n-58\\n-58\\n2021:Q4\\n-52\\n-53\\n2022:Q4\\n-49\\n-49\\n2023:Q4\\n-46\\n-46\\n2024:Q4\\n-42\\n-43\\n2025:Q4\\n-39\\n-40\\n2026:Q4\\n-37\\n-37\\n2027:Q4\\n-35\\n-35\\n2028:Q4\\n-33\\n-33\\n2029:Q4\\n-31\\n-31\\n2030:Q4\\n-29\\n-29\\nasterisk The  figure s sh ow the estim ated ef fe cts  on the  10-year  Tre asury t\\nerm premi um r esu lting f rom the F ederal Rese rve's  large-scale asset purchases.\\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 36 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n                   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\n \\n \\n \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            \\n  \\n \\n \\n        \\nProjections for the Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Securities Holdings\\nBalance Sheet & Income\\nClass I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)\\nApril 26, 2018\\nPage 37 of 40\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nsecurities portfolio to keep pace with the expansion in non-reserve liabilities.

We now estimate that real GDP was \\nabout unchanged in the first quarter\\u2014compared with a 1\\u00be percent increase in the March \\nprojection\\u2014and that industrial production contracted.1  Although the labor market \\ncontinued to improve last quarter, payrolls rose 70,000 per month less than we had \\nexpected, and the unemployment rate in March was 0.1 percentage point higher. \\nIn response to the incoming data, we lowered our projection for real GDP growth \\nin the second quarter to just under 2\\u00bd percent, \\u00bc percentage point less than in the March \\nTealbook, and trimmed our forecast for payroll gains in the coming months.  \\nNevertheless, we judge much of the weakness in the recent data to be the result of \\ntransitory factors or noise, with few implications for GDP growth beyond the first half of \\nthis year.  Over the medium term, monetary policy is assumed to be a bit more \\naccommodative in this projection, and other conditioning factors are a little more \\nsupportive, on balance, of economic growth.  All told, we revised up modestly our \\nforecast of output growth beyond the near term, with real GDP increasing about \\n2\\u00bd percent in the second half of this year and in 2016 before slowing to 2 percent in \\n2017.  At the end of the medium term, the level of real GDP is about \\u00bc percent below the \\nMarch Tealbook projection.  The output gap at that time is positive, but with our \\nunchanged supply-side assumptions, the gap is slightly smaller than in the March \\nTealbook.   \\nThe unemployment rate in the current projection declines from 5.5 percent in \\nMarch to 5.1 percent in the final quarter of 2017, slightly below our estimate of its natural \\nrate but a bit higher than in the March Tealbook.  The modest decrease in the \\nunemployment rate over the projection period remains more gradual than implied by the \\nchange in the GDP gap, as we continue to anticipate that an unwinding of the current \\nunusual weakness in labor force participation will attenuate the decline in the jobless rate. \\n                                                 \\n1 The BEA is scheduled to publish its initial estimate of first-quarter GDP on April 29, the second \\nday of the FOMC meeting. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 1 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n\\u00a0Box begins.\\nComparing\\u00a0the\\u00a0Staff\\u00a0Projection\\u00a0with\\u00a0Other\\u00a0Forecasts\\u00a0\\nThe\\u00a0staff\\u00a0forecasts\\u00a0of\\u00a0real\\u00a0GDP\\u00a0growth\\u00a0and\\u00a0inflation\\u00a0are,\\u00a0on\\u00a0balance,\\u00a0a\\u00a0little\\u00a0lower\\u00a0\\nthan\\u00a0the\\u00a0most\\u00a0recent\\u00a0Blue\\u00a0Chip\\u00a0Consensus\\u00a0outlook\\u00a0and\\u00a0the\\u00a0Survey\\u00a0of\\u00a0\\nProfessional\\u00a0Forecasters\\u00a0(SPF)\\u00a0median\\u00a0projection\\u00a0(although\\u00a0the\\u00a0latter\\u00a0dates\\u00a0from\\u00a0\\nmid\\u2010February).\\u00a0\\u00a0The\\u00a0staff\\u2019s\\u00a0forecast\\u00a0of\\u00a0the\\u00a0unemployment\\u00a0rate\\u00a0is\\u00a0a\\u00a0bit\\u00a0higher\\u00a0than\\u00a0\\nthose\\u00a0of\\u00a0the\\u00a0outside\\u00a0forecasts.\\u00a0\\nComparison of Tealbook and Outside Forecasts \\n  \\n2015 \\n2016 \\nGDP (Q4/Q4 percent change) \\n1.8 \\n2.4 \\nMarch Tealbook \\n2.2 \\n2.3 \\nBlue Chip (4/10/15) \\n2.7 \\n2.7 \\nSPF median (2/13/15) \\n2.8 \\nn.a. \\n \\n \\n \\nUnemployment rate (Q4 level) \\n5.3 \\n5.2 \\nMarch Tealbook \\n5.2 \\n5.1 \\nBlue Chip (4/10/15) \\n5.1 \\n4.9 \\nSPF median (2/13/15) \\n5.2 \\nn.a. \\n \\n \\n \\nConsumer price inflation (Q4/Q4 percent change) \\n0.7 \\n2.0 \\nMarch Tealbook \\n0.6 \\n2.1 \\nBlue Chip (4/10/15) \\n0.8 \\n2.2 \\nSPF median (2/13/15) \\n1.1 \\n2.1 \\n \\n \\n \\nPCE price inflation (Q4/Q4 percent change) \\n0.6 \\n1.6 \\nMarch Tealbook \\n0.6 \\n1.7 \\nSPF median (2/13/15) \\n1.1 \\n1.9 \\n \\n \\n \\nCore PCE price inflation (Q4/Q4 percent change) \\n1.3 \\n1.6 \\nMarch Tealbook \\n1.3 \\n1.6 \\nSPF median (2/13/15) \\n1.4 \\n1.7 \\n     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters.

Both estimates are \\nunrevised from the March Tealbook.  With these temporary influences on inflation \\nanticipated to fade, both headline and core price inflation are projected to be 1\\u00bd percent \\nin the current quarter and then to edge up to 1\\u00be percent by 2017, as energy prices rise, \\nimport prices turn up next year, and resource utilization tightens further.   \\nAs always, numerous risks attend our outlook.  We view the uncertainty around \\nour projection for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in \\nline with the average of the past 20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility.  \\nWe have maintained our assessment that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted \\nsomewhat to the downside, largely reflecting our view that neither monetary nor fiscal \\npolicy appears well positioned to offset substantial adverse shocks to the economy.  We \\nstill see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, as \\nthe downside risks to real activity are offset by the possibility that the unemployment rate \\ncould continue to decline more rapidly than we expect (despite the small upside surprises \\nin recent months).  Our concerns with respect to the inflation outlook remain mostly on \\nthe downside, given the still-muted readings on TIPS-based measures of inflation \\ncompensation and risks to domestic inflation from dollar appreciation.   \\nThe box \\u201cTealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 2014\\u201d discusses the \\nrecent errors in the staff\\u2019s forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.

This \\nsmall modification to our monetary policy assumption is broadly consistent \\nwith the responses to both the \\u201cflash\\u201d Survey of Primary Dealers conducted \\nfollowing the March FOMC meeting and the latest survey, as well as with \\nexpectations of liftoff suggested by the federal funds futures market.  As in \\nour previous projections, following liftoff, the federal funds rate is assumed to \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 5 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n Box begins.\\nTealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 2014 \\nAs was the case for 2013, staff forecasts were roughly in line with the latest \\nestimates of real GDP growth for 2014 but did not anticipate the sizable drop in the \\nunemployment rate.  Meanwhile, inflation in 2014 was slightly below the staff\\u2019s \\nexpectations.  Here we present and discuss these recent forecast errors. \\nThe gray bars in the left panel of figure 1 show the currently published Q4/Q4 percent \\nchanges in real GDP from 2011 to 2014; the blue squares show the forecasts for growth \\nmade in the April Tealbook one year prior, and the green triangles show the forecast \\nfrom the April Tealbook in the contemporaneous year.  The whisker bands around the \\nsquares and triangles demarcate 70 percent forecast-error bands, with unusually large \\nforecast errors represented by cases where the top of a gray bar (the actual value) falls \\noutside one of the whisker bands.  Because the bars themselves represent the latest \\nrevised data, the red dots show the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimate of \\nGDP growth for each year from April of the subsequent year (known as the third \\nestimates), along with 70 percent bands computed from past revisions. \\nThe staff errors in forecasting 2013 and 2014 GDP growth were not particularly large, \\nand while the forecasts for 2014 Q4/Q4 GDP growth currently appear slightly too high, \\nrevisions could easily reverse that conclusion\\u2014for example, forecasts of 2013 GDP \\ngrowth that earlier appeared slightly too high now appear to have been slightly too \\nlow, given the subsequent upward revisions to the BEA\\u2019s estimates.  Indeed, an array \\nof indicators suggest economic growth stepped up in 2014 from its 2013 pace, currently \\nestimated to be around 3 percent.  For example, the pace of payroll employment gains \\npicked up in 2014, and the unemployment rate fell by more than in prior years.  As such, \\nthe staff views GDP growth in 2014 as likely held down by measurement error, and an \\nupward revision to 2014 GDP growth would not be surprising. \\n \\n  \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 6 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n Box ends.\\n \\nAs shown in the right panel of figure 1, the staff\\u2019s errors in forecasting the \\nunemployment rate in 2014:Q4 were unusually large.  In addition, the staff\\u2019s \\nprojections for the unemployment rate one quarter and further ahead were \\nconsistently too high from August 2011 to October 2014, with the forecast errors \\nreflecting a mix of lower-than-expected labor force participation and higher-than-\\nexpected household survey employment.  Payroll employment gains (not shown) also \\nwere larger in 2014 than the staff had anticipated. \\nFigure 2 shows the staff\\u2019s forecasts, with standard error bands, for total and core PCE \\nprice inflation along with the latest estimates from 2011 to 2014.  The figure shows that \\nthe errors in forecasting 2014 inflation were not particularly large.  The \\ncontemporaneous-year forecast error for 2014 inflation was concentrated in energy, \\nreflecting lower-than-anticipated crude oil prices, while the error in forecasting 2014 \\ninflation one year ahead was spread across more categories, including the broad non-\\nenergy, non-housing services category. \\nThe staff compensation growth forecasts (not shown) also appear to have been \\nslightly too high recently\\u2014for example, the staff forecast of the four-quarter growth \\nrate of the employment cost index for hourly compensation over 2014 was 2\\u00be percent \\nin April 2013 and 2\\u00bd percent in April 2014, above the current published value of \\n2\\u00bc percent.  Similarly, the staff forecast of the four-quarter growth rate of nonfarm \\nbusiness compensation per hour over 2014 was about 3 percent in April 2013 and \\n2\\u00bd percent in April 2014, compared with the current Bureau of Labor Statistics \\nestimate of 2\\u00bd percent.1 \\n                                                 \\n1 The staff recently switched from forecasting nonfarm business compensation per hour (CPH) to \\nbusiness CPH, which shows a slightly lower Q4/Q4 growth rate in 2014, around 2\\u00bc percent instead of \\n2\\u00bd percent.    \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 7 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nrise at a pace determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the \\nTaylor (1999) policy rule.  The projected path of the federal funds rate is a bit \\nlower than in the March projection, reaching an average of 2.3 percent in the \\nfourth quarter of 2017.2 \\nOther Interest Rates \\n\\uf0b7 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise \\nsignificantly, albeit a bit less steeply than in previous rounds.  This downward \\nrevision reflects the new trajectory of expected short-term rates along with a \\nslightly lower projected path for the term premium.  The rising path of the \\nTreasury yield reflects the movement of the 10-year valuation window \\nthrough the period of extremely low short-term interest rates, as well as an \\nincrease in term premiums that is due in part to the waning of the effects of \\nthe FOMC\\u2019s balance sheet policies.   \\n\\uf0b7 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium \\nterm have been revised essentially in line with the changes to the path for the \\nTreasury yield. \\nEquity Prices and Home Prices \\n\\uf0b7 Equity prices are projected to rise 6 percent per year over the forecast period, \\na little slower than in the March Tealbook.  This revision reflects a slightly \\nshallower projected decline in the equity premium. \\n\\uf0b7 Incoming data on house prices have been in line with our expectations, \\nleaving our forecast little changed from the March Tealbook.  We continue to \\nproject that house price appreciation will slow, from 4\\u00be percent last year to an \\naverage rate of about 3\\u00bc percent per year from 2015 to 2017.  \\nFiscal Policy \\n\\uf0b7 We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.  \\nWe continue to anticipate that fiscal policy actions at all levels of government \\n                                                 \\n2 If we had maintained our assumption that the federal funds rate would lift off in June, the \\nFRB/US model projects that, relative to our current forecast, real GDP growth would be less than \\n0.1 percentage point weaker in both 2016 and 2017, the unemployment rate would be less than \\n0.1 percentage point higher at the end of 2017, inflation would be a couple of basis points lower in 2017, \\nand the federal funds rate would be about 15 basis points higher at the end of the medium term. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 8 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwill swing from a small drag on real GDP growth in 2014 to a small stimulus \\nthis year and over the rest of the medium term.   \\nForeign Economic Activity and the Dollar \\n\\uf0b7 We estimate that foreign real GDP growth slowed from an annual rate of \\n2\\u00be percent in the second half of 2014 to a surprisingly low 1\\u00be percent in the \\nfirst quarter of this year.  We project that foreign economic growth will \\nbounce back and reach 3 percent by the end of this year\\u2014supported by \\naccommodative monetary policies, depreciated currencies, and still-low oil \\nprices\\u2014and that it will maintain this pace, roughly its trend rate, in 2016 and \\n2017.  Foreign real GDP growth in the first half of 2015 is \\u00bd percentage point \\nlower than in the March Tealbook and is essentially unrevised thereafter.   \\n\\uf0b7 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated about 2 percent since the March \\nTealbook, consistent with the downward shift in the expected path of the \\nfederal funds rate and weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data.  However, \\nwe project that the nominal dollar will appreciate 2\\u00be percent through the \\nremainder of 2015 as investors refocus their attention on the divergence \\nbetween expected monetary policies in the United States and abroad.  \\nThereafter, as foreign economic growth firms and as some tail risks for the \\neuro-area economy diminish, the nominal dollar is projected to weaken.  Our \\nforecast leaves the broad real dollar about 1\\u00bd percent lower at the end of the \\nforecast period relative to the previous Tealbook.  \\nOil and Other Commodity Prices \\n\\uf0b7 The spot price of Brent crude oil has risen $6 per barrel since the time of the \\nMarch Tealbook, reaching $62 per barrel on April 21.  The rise appears \\nprimarily to reflect signs that U.S. production may level out soon, which \\nwould help reduce the current supply glut.  Prices for futures contracts with \\ndelivery at the end of 2017 were little changed.  We expect the price of \\nimported oil to move up from $56 per barrel this quarter to about $64 per \\nbarrel by the end of the forecast period\\u2014a projected path that, relative to the \\nMarch Tealbook, is $3 per barrel higher in the second half of this year and \\nlittle changed on average for the remainder of the forecast period. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 9 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nSummary of the Near-Term Outlook\\n(Percent change at annual rate except as noted)\\n2014:Q4\\n2015:Q1\\n2015:Q2\\n \\n \\n \\n                        Measure\\nPrevious\\nCurrent\\nPrevious\\nCurrent\\nPrevious\\nCurrent\\nTealbook\\nTealbook\\nTealbook\\nTealbook\\nTealbook\\nTealbook\\nReal GDP\\n2.1\\n2.2\\n1.7\\n.1\\n2.6\\n2.4\\n  Private domestic final purchases\\n4.3\\n4.5\\n3.0\\n.9\\n4.1\\n3.1\\n    Personal consumption expenditures\\n4.2\\n4.4\\n3.5\\n1.9\\n4.4\\n4.2\\n    Residential investment\\n4.5\\n3.8\\n1.4\\n1.8\\n8.5\\n1.1\\n    Nonres. private fixed investment\\n4.4\\n4.7\\n.7\\n-4.3\\n1.5\\n-1.9\\n  Government purchases\\n-2.0\\n-1.9\\n-.8\\n-2.3\\n.1\\n1.3\\n  Contributions to change in real GDP\\n  Inventory investment1        \\n-.1\\n-.1\\n.1\\n.4\\n.1\\n.2\\n  Net exports1        \\n-1.0\\n-1.0\\n-.7\\n-.6\\n-1.0\\n-.6\\nUnemployment rate2        \\n5.7\\n5.7\\n5.5\\n5.6\\n5.3\\n5.4\\nPCE chain price index\\n-.4\\n-.4\\n-2.0\\n-2.0\\n1.3\\n1.5\\n  Ex. food and energy\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n.8\\n.8\\n1.4\\n1.6\\n  1.

However, the price of copper moved higher because of supply \\ndisruptions.   \\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP \\nAs noted earlier, the incoming spending data have been disappointing, on balance, \\nand we have downgraded our estimates for nearly all of the major categories of final sales \\nin the first quarter.  We currently estimate that real GDP was about unchanged last \\nquarter, compared with a 1\\u00be percent increase in the March Tealbook.  (Estimates of first-\\nquarter GDP growth from most other near-term forecasting approaches within the System \\nhave also revised down considerably over the past two months.  See the box \\u201cNowcasting \\nModels within the Federal Reserve System.\\u201d)  While we judge some of the weakness \\nseen in a variety of indicators to be the result of transitory factors or statistical noise, we \\nalso perceive some of the incoming data as suggesting a slower pace of underlying \\nspending than we had previously expected.3  As a result, we have marked down slightly \\nthe projected second-quarter increase in real GDP to a little below 2\\u00bd percent.  \\n\\uf0b7 Much of the downward revision to our first-quarter estimate reflects a \\nconsiderable slowing in real PCE growth, from 4\\u00bd percent in the fourth \\nquarter of last year to only 2 percent in the first quarter of this year, about \\n1\\u00bd percentage points less than we expected in the March Tealbook.  We have \\nattributed some of the weakness in first-quarter consumer spending to \\ntransitory factors.  For example, light motor vehicle sales rebounded in March, \\nconsistent with our assumption that February sales had been held down by \\nunusually bad weather.  However, core retail sales bounced back in March by \\nless than we expected, and overall PCE appears inexplicably soft last quarter.  \\nWith the fundamentals underpinning consumer spending remaining solid, we \\nexpect real PCE growth to step up to a 4\\u00bc percent pace in the current quarter, \\nonly about \\u00bc percentage point less than in the March forecast.  (For \\ninformation on recent developments in households\\u2019 health-care spending, see \\n                                                 \\n3 These transitory factors include the harsh weather in February, disrupted production associated \\nwith the West Coast port dispute, a measurement problem for core retail sales that is related to the inclusion \\nof gasoline sales in the tallies for some large retailers, and apparent residual seasonality in the data on state \\nand local government construction spending. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22,

We attribute some of the weaker-than-anticipated \\nreadings on housing construction to the severe winter weather in February, but \\nthe paltry March rebound in starts and permits suggests that weather was not \\nthe principal factor depressing construction activity.  Consequently, we \\nmarked down our projection for housing starts in the coming months and now \\nexpect real residential investment to increase at an annual rate of only \\n1\\u00bd percent in the first half of this year, 3\\u00bd percentage points less than in the \\nprevious Tealbook.   \\n\\uf0b7 Business fixed investment is forecast to decline in the first half of the year \\ncompared with the small gain projected in the March Tealbook.  In particular, \\nspending on nonresidential structures is now projected to fall at an annual rate \\nof 20 percent in the first half, reflecting a plunge in outlays on drilling \\nstructures in response to the earlier drop in crude oil prices.  Moreover, we \\nexpect outlays on equipment and intangibles to rise only modestly in the first \\nhalf, consistent with weak recent data on orders, shipments, and net imports of \\ncapital goods, as well as tepid forward-looking indicators of business \\nspending. \\n\\uf0b7 Both real exports and real imports appear considerably weaker in the first \\nquarter than expected in the March Tealbook.  However, taken as a whole, net \\nexports are projected to be a bit less of a drag on GDP growth than in our \\nprevious projection.4  Net exports are now estimated to have subtracted \\n\\u2154 percentage point from real GDP growth in the first quarter, and they are \\nexpected to subtract the same amount in the second as exports flatten out and \\nimports rebound.  \\n\\uf0b7 In the industrial sector, mining output fell last quarter as the sharp declines in \\nthe drilling of new oil and gas wells were only partly offset by continuing \\nincreases in the extraction of oil and gas from existing wells.  Manufacturing \\n                                                 \\n4 Although the West Coast port labor dispute likely reduced both exports and, especially, imports \\nin the first quarter, the February decline was too large for the labor dispute to be the primary explanation. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 15 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n Box begins.\\nIn this discussion, we examine changes in health insurance coverage and medical \\nspending during the first year of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  Although the ACA \\nbecame law in 2010, implementation of the major components began only in 2014.  \\nThe four main provisions of the ACA, designed to increase health insurance coverage, are \\nthe expansion of Medicaid eligibility, the introduction of health insurance exchanges, the \\nindividual mandate, and the employer mandate.  In 2014, the expansion of Medicaid \\neligibility to adults with household incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty line was \\nadopted by 28 states and the District of Columbia.1  These locations accounted for \\n9\\u00bd million net new Medicaid enrollees.2  States that did not expand eligibility added \\n1\\u00bd million net new enrollees.3  The health insurance exchanges\\u2014government-\\nadministered marketplaces where individuals can purchase insurance and receive income-\\nbased subsidies for premiums\\u2014enrolled another 8 million individuals.  An estimated \\n57 percent of these enrollees were previously uninsured.4  All told, as shown in the figure \\nbelow, the uninsured rate for adults age 18 to 64 fell from about 18 percent at the end of \\n2013 to about 13 percent by the end of 2014.  The uninsured rate in states that expanded \\n                                                 \\n1 Prior to the Medicaid expansion, childless adults in most states were not eligible for Medicaid or \\nthe income limit was lower than 138 percent of the poverty line. \\n2 See Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \\n(2015), Medicaid and CHIP:  January 2015 Monthly Applications, Eligibility Determinations and Enrollment \\nReport (Washington:  HHS, March), http://medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/program-\\ninformation/downloads/medicaid-and-chip-january-2015-application-eligibility-and-enrollment-data.pdf. \\n3 Increased Medicaid enrollment in states that did not expand eligibility may reflect increased \\nawareness of Medicaid eligibility because of the publicity surrounding the ACA, easier enrollment in \\nMedicaid through the health insurance exchanges, and greater demand for insurance coverage as a \\nresult of the individual mandate. \\n4 See Kaiser Family Foundation (2014), Survey of Non-group Health Insurance Enrollees (Menlo Park, \\nCalif.:  KFF, June), http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/survey-of-non-group-\\nhealth-insurance-enrollees-findings-final1.pdf.  \\n \\nHealth Insurance Coverage and Medical Spending \\nin the First Year of the Affordable Care Act \\n \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 16 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n Box ends.\\nMedicaid eligibility declined 5 percentage points (from a level of 15 percent) compared \\nwith a 4 percentage point decrease (from a level of 20 percent) for states that did not \\nexpand Medicaid eligibility. \\nGiven the rise in the number of people with health insurance, it seems likely that the ACA \\nboosted spending on health-care-related goods and services.  However, parsing out the \\nincrease in spending directly associated with the ACA is not straightforward, as other \\nfactors may also have caused outlays for health care to increase in 2014.  One approach is \\nto compare the increase in health spending in 2014 with the average increase in past \\nyears in order to roughly net out the influence of other factors.  Our preferred measure \\nof health spending, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for health-care goods \\nand services, grew 4.1 percent over the four quarters of 2014.  In the three years prior to \\nthe implementation of the ACA, health spending rose an average of 2.7 percent.  The \\ndifference between these growth rates is consistent with the ACA boosting real PCE \\nhealth spending growth roughly 1\\u00bc percentage points in 2014.  \\nAnother approach to estimating the effect of the ACA on real PCE health spending is to \\ncombine the decline in the uninsured rate during 2014 with assumptions about average \\nhealth spending by uninsured and insured individuals; in particular, we assume that the \\nnewly insured spend twice as much on health care as uninsured people of the same age.5  \\nThis method suggests that the ACA boosted the growth in real PCE health spending \\n1.2 percentage points in 2014.  Thus, both approaches point to an increase in health \\nspending growth of roughly 1\\u00bc percentage points.  In dollar terms, this suggests that the \\nACA increased PCE health spending by $30 billion, equivalent to adding 0.2 percentage \\npoint to the growth rate of real GDP in 2014.6 \\nLooking forward to 2015, we expect the uninsured rate to continue to fall, but the \\nmagnitude of any further decline depends on a number of factors.  One is whether \\nadditional states choose to expand Medicaid eligibility.  Another is that individuals who \\nfailed to obtain insurance will be paying the individual mandate penalty for the first time \\nthis year (as 2014 final tax payments were due by April 15).  Paying the penalty may \\nincrease its salience and lead to increased enrollment in the exchanges.  Moreover, the \\npenalty rises in 2015 and again in 2016.  Finally, the employer mandate for firms with \\n100 or more employees began this year, although this mandate is expected to have only \\nmodest consequences, as the vast majority of these firms already offer health insurance \\nto their employees. \\n                                                 \\n5 This assumption is based on the results in Jack Hadley and John Holahan (2003), \\u201cCovering the \\nUninsured:  How Much Would It Cost?\\u201d Health Affairs, June, \\nhttp://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2003/06/04/hlthaff.w3.250/suppl/DC1. \\n6 In addition, the ACA may have increased nonhealth spending, as the subsidies may have freed up \\nconsumer resources that were formerly devoted to purchasing insurance.  Offsetting these effects, the \\nincreased taxes and cuts to Medicare providers used to finance the expansion probably reduced \\naggregate demand. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 17 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\noutput also moved down last quarter, reflecting both temporary factors (such \\nas the West Coast port labor dispute) and longer-lived factors (such as weaker \\ndemand due to the appreciation of the dollar).  Looking ahead, the survey-\\nbased measures of new orders activity are at levels that suggest only a modest \\nrise in factory output this quarter, leaving a projected first-half pace that is \\nmuch weaker than that in the March Tealbook. \\nTHE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP \\nGiven our view that much of the recent weakness in real activity likely reflects \\ntransitory influences, we continue to project that real GDP will increase about 2\\u00bc percent \\nper year, on average, over the medium term.  As in previous Tealbooks, we expect the \\nongoing normalization of monetary policy to weigh more heavily on economic growth \\nover time. \\n\\uf0b7 We expect real GDP to increase at an annual rate of 2\\u00bd percent in the second \\nhalf of this year, just a touch faster than in the March Tealbook, as the slightly \\nweaker momentum in domestic spending suggested by the recent data is a bit \\nmore than offset by the effect of the lower dollar on net exports; for the year \\nas a whole, GDP growth is 1\\u00be percent, \\u00bd percentage point less than in the \\nMarch Tealbook.  Real GDP is projected to increase 2\\u00bd percent next year\\u2014a \\nshade faster than in the March projection, as the lower interest rates and the \\nlower dollar provide a greater boost to activity\\u2014and then to slow to 2 percent \\nin 2017.  All told, the level of real GDP at the end of the medium term is \\n\\u00bc percent lower than in the March Tealbook. \\n\\uf0b7 In previous Tealbooks, we have often interpreted a divergence in signals of \\nslack as a reason to adjust our supply-side assumptions.  However, the \\nincoming data for spending, production, and the labor market all suggest \\nslightly greater resource slack than we had projected in March.  As a result, \\nwe did not change our forecast of potential output in this projection, which \\nrises about 1\\u00bd percent this year and 1\\u00be percent over the rest of the medium \\nterm.  Real GDP rises somewhat faster than potential output over the medium \\nterm and is \\u00bc percent above its potential at the end of 2017, a slightly smaller \\noutput gap compared with the March Tealbook given the downward revision \\nto GDP in this projection.   \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 18 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTHE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET \\nAlthough the March employment report was not as strong as we had expected, the \\nlabor market has continued to improve in recent months.  In the near term, we expect \\npayroll employment to rise at a similar rate as in the first quarter and the unemployment \\nrate to edge down further.  \\n\\uf0b7 The smaller-than-expected payroll increase in March followed several months \\nof outsized gains.  For the first quarter as a whole, payroll employment growth \\naveraged about 200,000 per month.  This pace, while still solid, is roughly \\n70,000 less than we had projected at the time of the March Tealbook. \\n\\uf0b7 The unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent in March, whereas we had \\nprojected it to move down 0.1 percentage point.  Similarly, the labor force \\nparticipation rate was lower than anticipated, edging down 0.1 percentage \\npoint, whereas we had expected it to be flat.  \\n\\uf0b7 The staff\\u2019s labor market conditions index indicated that the labor market \\ncontinued to improve in the first quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the \\nsecond half of last year. \\n\\uf0b7 We expect payroll employment to rise about 200,000 jobs per month this \\nquarter and the unemployment rate to edge down to 5.4 percent.  Relative to \\nthe March Tealbook, projected payroll gains average 40,000 less per month \\nand the projected unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point higher. \\nConsistent with the modest revision to real output over our medium-term \\nprojection, the outlook for the labor market is little changed. \\n\\uf0b7 We expect monthly private job gains to average about 200,000 in the second \\nhalf of this year, the same pace as in the first half.  Increases in payroll \\nemployment are expected to slow to around 165,000 in 2016 and 125,000 in \\n2017, as productivity moves back up toward its trend.   \\n\\uf0b7 The unemployment rate is projected to move down from an average of \\n5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year to 5.1 percent at the end of 2017.  \\nThe path of the unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point higher over the \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 19 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nprojection period, which is consistent with the slightly weaker path of the \\nGDP gap. \\n\\uf0b7 As in previous Tealbooks, we view the unemployment rate gap as currently \\nunderstating the amount of slack remaining in the labor market as a result of \\nan unusually low labor force participation rate and an unusually elevated level \\nof involuntary part-time employment.  As the economy continues to improve, \\nwe expect more individuals to be drawn into the labor market and the rate of \\ninvoluntary part-time employment to move down.  The improvement in labor \\nforce participation relative to its trend attenuates the decline in the \\nunemployment rate, which only edges down over the next three years even as \\nGDP continues to increase moderately faster than its potential.   \\nTHE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION \\nRecent data on inflation have been a touch higher, on balance, than anticipated in \\nour March Tealbook projection and support our expectation that consumer price inflation \\nwill step up in the second quarter.  Over the medium term, our forecast for PCE inflation \\nis little changed.   \\n\\uf0b7 We estimate that total PCE prices fell at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first \\nquarter, principally reflecting a steep drop in consumer energy prices, and \\ncore PCE prices rose just \\u00be percent.  Our estimates for both total and core \\nPCE inflation are unchanged from the March Tealbook, as a slightly higher \\nreading on core CPI prices in March was offset by softer medical services \\nprices implied by incoming PPI data.   \\n\\uf0b7 Factoring in the March CPI data and the slightly higher path of oil prices, we \\nnow project both total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation to rise to about \\n1\\u00bd percent in the second quarter, roughly \\u00bc percentage point above the \\nMarch projection.5 \\n\\uf0b7 Following the declines in farm commodity prices observed late last year and \\nearly this year, indexes of spot and futures prices for foodstuffs have been \\nrelatively stable.  That said, the data on consumer food prices surprised us on \\n                                                 \\n5 Despite a projected upturn in total PCE prices in the second quarter, the 12-month change in this \\nprice measure is expected to edge lower in coming months and temporarily turn negative in June. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 20 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nthe downside, and our current forecast for the first half of this year is \\nnoticeably lower than in the March Tealbook.  We now estimate that PCE \\nfood prices edged down in the first quarter, and we project them to decrease at \\na similar pace in the second quarter.6  In the medium term, consumer food \\nprices are projected to rise at a pace in line with core inflation.  \\nBeyond the near term, we expect inflation to move up gradually to 1\\u00be percent as \\nenergy prices rise, import prices turn up next year, and resource utilization tightens \\nfurther in an environment of well-anchored long-run inflation expectations. \\n\\uf0b7 Core import prices are expected to decline at an average annual rate of \\n4 percent in the first half of this year, reflecting the previous appreciation of \\nthe dollar and net declines in commodity prices as well as unusually low \\nforeign inflation.  With our projection that the dollar will peak early next year \\nand foreign CPI inflation will pick up, core import price inflation is expected \\nto turn positive by the start of 2016 and move up to 1\\u00be percent in 2017.  (See \\nthe box \\u201cThe Effect of the Dollar on U.S. Core Import and Consumer Prices.\\u201d) \\n\\uf0b7 Expected PCE inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of \\nProfessional Forecasters (SPF) remains unchanged at the FOMC\\u2019s longer-run \\ninflation objective.  However, the preliminary April reading on expected \\ninflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan Survey ticked down to \\nthe bottom of the range seen over recent years.  TIPS-based measures of \\ninflation compensation have been little changed recently and remain only \\nslightly above the low levels observed earlier this year.  We have not altered \\nour assessment of the level of long-term inflation expectations relevant for \\nwage and price setting, but one of the scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty \\nsection explores the possibility that these long-term inflation expectations are \\nlower than we assume.   \\n\\uf0b7 With import prices expected to begin to turn up early next year and with labor \\nand product markets tightening, we continue to project core PCE price \\ninflation to rise from 1\\u00bc percent this year to 1\\u00be percent in 2017.  As \\nconsumer energy prices are projected to rise only a bit faster than core prices \\n                                                 \\n6 Even though drought conditions in California worsened, prices of fruits and vegetables in March \\nwere lower than we expected. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 21 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n  \\n Box begins.\\nThe Effect of the Dollar on U.S. Core Import and Consumer Prices \\nSince last summer, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated 13 percent (see figure 1 on the \\nnext page).  A stronger dollar lowers U.S. inflation by reducing the prices we pay for our \\nimported goods and services.  This discussion reviews our estimates of the exchange rate \\npass-through to U.S. core import prices and examines the implications of these estimates for \\nour forecast of core PCE inflation.1 \\nThe prices we pay for our imports reflect the value of our exchange rate as well as foreign \\nprices for these products and global commodity prices.  In terms of forecasting import \\nprices, the staff finds it useful to focus on the prices of imported \\u201ccore goods,\\u201d which we \\ndefine as imports of goods excluding oil, natural gas, computers, and semiconductors.2  \\nAccording to the staff\\u2019s econometric model of core import prices, a 10 percent dollar \\nappreciation is estimated to reduce the level of core import prices by 3 percent, all within \\ntwo quarters.  This relatively small effect reflects, in part, that, for reasons of competition \\nand market structure, producers tend to vary their markup over cost rather than allow the \\ndollar prices of their goods to move fully with exchange rates.3  Our pass-through estimate \\nof one-third is within the range of estimates in the academic literature.      \\nDeclines in core goods import prices, in turn, depress U.S. core PCE inflation, as these \\nimports constitute part of the U.S. consumption basket.  Core PCE prices are also held down \\nindirectly through the drag that an appreciation of the dollar has on net exports and, thus, \\non aggregate demand.  All told, including these \\u201cGDP effects,\\u201d the staff\\u2019s judgmental \\nforecasting rule is that a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar lowers U.S. core PCE inflation \\nnearly \\u00bc percentage point in each of the first two years following the shock, and \\n0.1 percentage point in the third year.  This somewhat limited effect reflects both the small \\npass-through from the dollar to import prices and the small share of core imports\\u2014about \\n10 percent\\u2014in U.S. GDP.   \\nThe recent behavior of core goods import price inflation and our staff forecast are shown by \\nthe solid black line in figure 2 on the next page.  As can be seen, core import prices have \\nfallen sharply and are expected to continue to decline in the near term.  To assess the role of \\nthe dollar in this decline, we compare the import price model\\u2019s current prediction (the \\ndashed red line) with the prediction if we keep all else equal but use the dollar path from the \\nJune 2014 Tealbook, before the dollar\\u2019s run-up (the solid red line).4  The model attributes \\n                                                 \\n1Although this discussion focuses on how the dollar affects core import inflation and core PCE inflation, \\na rise in the dollar also lowers the dollar price of oil.  The lower oil price reduces headline inflation by \\nsomewhat more than core PCE inflation, but that difference is only material in the near term.   \\n2 We exclude these categories because they can obscure the economic signals coming from underlying \\nimport prices.  Oil and natural gas prices are very volatile, and the price indexes for computers and \\nsemiconductors are constructed to account for the rapid pace of technological change, which makes them \\nbehave very differently from other goods.   \\n3 Another reason for low pass-through is that, reflecting the importance of global supply chains, many \\nimported goods are produced using intermediate inputs whose costs are fixed in dollars.   \\n4 In making this comparison, we incorporate the implications that the different path of the dollar has \\nfor nonfuel commodity prices.   \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 22 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n  \\n Box ends.\\nmuch of the weakness in import prices to the sharp appreciation of the dollar, as can be seen \\nby comparing the two model paths. \\nAs mentioned above, our model estimates of the pass-through of exchange rate changes to \\ncore goods import prices are consistent with those in the literature, but there is a range of \\nthese estimates.  Although, so far, core goods import prices have declined less than what \\nour model predicts, there is a risk that pass-through going forward will be higher than our \\ncurrent estimate.  We examine this possibility using the staff\\u2019s SIGMA model.  In particular, \\nwe compare the effect of an additional 10 percent appreciation of the dollar using our \\nstandard version of SIGMA (where pass-through is about one-third) with the case where \\npass-through is assumed to be one-half.5  This higher pass-through represents the upper end \\nof the plausible estimates in the literature.  As can be seen by comparing the red and blue \\nlines in figure 3, the higher pass-through coefficient amplifies the effect of the dollar on core \\nimport price inflation, reducing it by about 1 percentage point in the first year and by \\nsomewhat less in the second.  The effect of higher pass-through on core PCE inflation, \\nshown in figure 4, is smaller; core PCE inflation falls about \\u00bc percentage point more than in \\nthe standard pass-through case in each of the two years following the shock.   \\n \\n      \\n                                                 \\n5 The details of this simulation using the standard pass-through assumption is presented in the \\n\\u201cStronger dollar\\u201d scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook.  Note that the PCE price \\nresponse in SIGMA is somewhat larger than the response in the judgmental forecast, primarily because \\ninflation is more sensitive to resource slack in SIGMA.    \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 23 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nafter the first quarter, total PCE inflation runs at about the same pace as core \\ninflation through the medium term. \\n\\uf0b7 We have received little data on compensation since the previous Tealbook, but \\nthe data we did receive continue to suggest that recent wage increases remain \\nsubdued:  In the 12 months through March, average hourly earnings of all \\nemployees increased 2 percent, in line with our forecast in the March \\nTealbook.  As labor markets tighten over the forecast period, we continue to \\nexpect hourly compensation to accelerate, with increases in the productivity \\nand cost measure of compensation picking up from 2\\u00bc percent last year to \\nabout 3 percent this year and to 3\\u00bd percent in 2016 and 2017.   \\nTHE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK \\n\\uf0b7 The federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescriptions of an \\ninertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  This policy rule assumes a long-run \\nequilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3\\u00bd percent. \\n\\uf0b7 The federal funds rate rises further after 2017 and reaches its long-run value \\nby 2020. \\n\\uf0b7 As monetary accommodation continues to be withdrawn, real GDP growth \\nslows to 1\\u00be percent in 2018 and in 2019, just slightly below the growth rate \\nof potential.  The unemployment rate moves down to 5.0 percent in 2018 \\nbefore edging up to its natural rate of 5.2 percent.  \\n\\uf0b7 PCE price inflation remains slightly below the Committee\\u2019s long-run \\nobjective at the end of 2017.  However, with the unemployment rate below the \\nnatural rate, longer-run inflation expectations gradually edge up and PCE \\nprice inflation increases to 2 percent by 2019. \\nDomestic Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC -

The deceleration in GDP was widespread \\nacross advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) and \\nwas accompanied by a slowing in industrial production and international trade.   \\nAlthough the recent weakness gives us pause, we do not expect the first-quarter \\nslump to persist.  Part of the unexpected decline reflected a greater-than-anticipated hit \\nfrom lower oil prices to economic activity in Canada\\u2014our largest trading partner\\u2014and, \\nwith oil prices stabilizing, we expect this effect to dissipate.  A dip in Chinese growth \\nalso is expected to be retraced as the authorities add to policy stimulus.  In addition, a \\nprojected step-up in U.S. growth from its first-quarter weakness, along with the \\ncontinuation of highly accommodative monetary policies and the positive effects of past \\ncurrency depreciation, should support activity abroad.  Thus, we continue to project that \\nforeign growth will rise to a near-trend pace of 3 percent by late this year and remain at \\nthat pace in 2016 and 2017.  That said, we certainly see a risk that the first-quarter slump \\nreflects deeper underlying weakness in the foreign economies than we have assumed.   \\nAlthough data suggest that euro-area activity is improving, the situation in Greece \\nhas grown more worrisome.  The Greek government is running out of cash and there has \\nbeen little apparent progress toward an agreement with its official creditors that would \\nunlock loan disbursements.  We judge there to be an appreciable likelihood that Greece \\nwill impose capital controls and miss debt payments in coming months, increasing the \\nrisk that it will eventually leave the euro area.  Because we also assume that European \\nauthorities will take concerted actions to protect other peripheral economies from \\ndisarray, Greek developments are still expected to have fairly limited spillovers to the rest \\nof the euro area.  However, we see a significant risk of a Greek exit that prompts a much \\nmore adverse reaction, one that roils financial markets and plunges the euro area back \\ninto recession.  We describe such a scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section. \\nData on foreign inflation have come in about as expected.  In the AFEs, we \\nestimate that consumer prices fell at an annual rate of \\u00be percent in the first quarter \\nfollowing a \\u00bd percent decline in the fourth.  As energy prices rise and earlier currency \\nInt\\u2019l Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 37 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\ndepreciation passes through to consumer prices, inflation should move up to 1 percent \\nthis quarter and to 1\\u00be percent by late 2016, also supported by diminishing resource slack.  \\nSimilarly, in the EMEs, consumer price inflation dipped to just \\u00bd percent in the first \\nquarter, in part because of a steep decline in retail energy prices, but should rise back \\ntoward 3 percent in coming quarters. \\nAmid low inflation and continued economic slack, we see monetary policy \\nremaining highly accommodative in the AFEs and relatively easy in many EMEs as well.  \\nIn contrast to the previous intermeeting period, central banks have taken few new policy \\nactions since the March FOMC meeting.  A notable exception is China, where the \\nauthorities cut the reserve requirement ratio to support economic growth. \\nADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES \\n\\uf0b7 Euro area.  Recent indicators of economic activity, including industrial \\nproduction, retail sales, and the composite purchasing managers index (PMI), \\nsuggest further firming of GDP growth, which we estimate at 1\\u00be percent in \\nthe first quarter.  We continue to see strong fundamental support for euro-area \\ngrowth from ongoing monetary stimulus, past currency depreciation and oil \\nprice declines, and easing credit conditions.  We see these positive factors \\noutweighing the negative effect of Greek developments, described in the \\nfollowing paragraph, helping euro-area GDP growth to rise to almost \\n2 percent in the second half of this year and to average 2\\u00bc percent in 2016 \\nand 2017.  Inflation was negative 1\\u00bd percent at an annual rate last quarter, \\nclose to our projection in the March Tealbook.  As energy prices stabilize and \\nthe output gap narrows, inflation should rise to 1\\u00bd percent by the end of this \\nyear and 1\\u00be percent by the end of 2017.  We continue to expect the European \\nCentral Bank (ECB) to purchase assets totaling about \\u20ac1.2 trillion by \\nSeptember 2016 and to keep its main policy rate near zero through the end of \\n2017.   \\nNegotiations between Greece and its creditors aimed at unlocking financial \\nassistance from European authorities and the International Monetary Fund \\ncontinue to be extraordinarily difficult.  Despite some progress in recent \\nweeks, the two sides remain far from an agreement.  Meanwhile, the Greek \\ngovernment is running out of cash, and concerns are mounting that it will \\ndefault on some of the nearly \\u20ac3 billion in payments on its medium- and long-\\nInt\\u2019l Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 38 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nterm debt coming due over the next month.  These fears have apparently \\nintensified deposit outflows from Greek banks in recent weeks.  All told, we \\nsee an appreciable likelihood of capital controls and sovereign default, which \\ncould eventually culminate in Greek exit from the euro area.  In our baseline \\noutlook, spillovers to the rest of the euro area from financial turmoil in Greece \\nare limited, reflecting reduced exposure by European banks to Greece, support \\nfrom the ECB\\u2019s ongoing sovereign debt purchases, and expectations that \\nEuropean authorities will take aggressive actions to keep remaining peripheral \\neconomies in the euro area.  Thus, financial tensions emanating from Greece \\nexert only a modest drag on euro-area growth this year.  However, \\nconsiderably more-adverse responses to a Greek default or exit represent a \\nsubstantial downside risk to the outlook. \\n\\uf0b7 Canada.  We now estimate that real GDP growth slowed to \\u00bc percent in the \\nfirst quarter, more than 1 percentage point below our March Tealbook \\nestimate.  January monthly GDP fell, February imports of machinery and \\nequipment\\u2014which are highly correlated with investment\\u2014declined, and the \\nMarch manufacturing PMI remained in contractionary territory for a second \\nmonth.  These data likely reflect the harsh winter weather, a sharper-than-\\nexpected effect of the decline in oil prices on Canada\\u2019s oil sector, and slowing \\nU.S. demand.  As these effects dissipate, we expect GDP growth to bounce \\nback to 1\\u00bd percent in the second quarter and to rise to 2\\u00bd percent in 2016.  \\nThe Canadian economy should be supported by the projected upward tilt in oil \\nprices, accommodative monetary policy, and moderate U.S. growth.  \\nCompared with the March Tealbook, this projection is \\u00bd percentage point \\nlower in 2015 and little changed thereafter. \\nAs expected in the March Tealbook, first-quarter consumer prices were flat, \\nheld down by lower energy prices.  As oil prices bottom out, we expect \\ninflation to bounce back to 1\\u00be percent in the second quarter and to reach the \\n2 percent target by 2017.  Amid contained inflation pressures and weaker \\ngrowth, we now expect the Bank of Canada to start tightening monetary \\npolicy in the second quarter of 2016, one quarter later than we had previously \\nassumed. \\n\\uf0b7 Japan.  We estimate that real GDP growth slowed to a 1 percent pace in the \\nfirst quarter from 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  This estimate is almost \\nInt\\u2019l Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 39 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 percentage point below our projection in the March Tealbook, reflecting \\nweaker-than-expected data for both the domestic and the external sectors.  \\nHowever, this year\\u2019s spring wage negotiations yielded the largest gains in \\nnearly two decades, supporting our forecast that private consumption will firm \\ngoing forward.  Accordingly, and amid considerable monetary policy \\nstimulus, we project that GDP growth will rise to 1\\u00bd percent this quarter and \\naverage just below that pace through 2016.  In 2017, the recovery will likely \\ngrind to a halt as a second hike to the consumption tax rate is implemented.  \\nConsumer prices appear to have been roughly flat in the first quarter, with \\nlower energy prices offsetting the boost from a depreciated yen.  With oil \\nprices picking up, we project that inflation will increase to \\u00be percent in the \\nsecond quarter.  Thereafter, as the output gap narrows and inflation \\nexpectations resume rising, we see inflation moving up to almost 1\\u00bd percent \\nby early 2017. \\n\\uf0b7 United Kingdom.  We estimate that real GDP growth moderated to 2 percent \\nin the first quarter from 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  This estimate is \\n\\u00bd percentage point below our forecast in the March Tealbook due to weaker-\\nthan-expected data on external trade, industrial production, and construction \\nactivity.  That said, PMIs and business confidence indicators through March \\nhave been strong, suggesting that growth will rebound to 2\\u00be percent in the \\nsecond quarter.  We expect GDP growth to remain robust through the \\nremainder of this year and next before moderating somewhat to 2\\u00bc percent by \\n2017 as the output gap closes.  Declines in food and energy prices pushed \\ninflation down to negative 1\\u00be percent at an annual rate in the first quarter.  \\nWe expect inflation to rebound and increase to the Bank of England\\u2019s (BOE) \\ntarget of 2 percent by 2017 as the transitory effects of lower energy prices \\ndissipate and slack in the U.K. economy is eliminated.  Given the BOE\\u2019s \\nrecent communication on the dangers of deflationary pressures in the United \\nKingdom, we have pushed back our expectation for the date of the BOE\\u2019s first \\nrate hike to the first quarter of 2016.  We continue to predict a gradual pace \\nfor subsequent policy rate increases. \\nEMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES \\n\\uf0b7 China.  Recently released GDP data indicate that economic growth in China \\nstepped down from an annual rate of 7 percent in the fourth quarter to only \\nInt\\u2019l Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 40 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5\\u00bc percent in the first quarter, 1\\u00be percentage points below our March \\nTealbook estimate.  Industrial production and exports dropped sharply in \\nMarch.  Indicators of domestic demand, such as fixed-asset investment and \\nretail sales growth, were somewhat stronger, although investment has \\ndecelerated considerably since the beginning of last year as the property \\nmarket has cooled.  We see growth picking up to a 7\\u00bc percent pace in the \\nsecond half of the year, supported by recent and further monetary easing as \\nauthorities seek to keep growth near their 7 percent target for this year; \\nauthorities already announced a 100 basis point cut in banks\\u2019 reserve \\nrequirement ratios.  Growth should also be supported by a strengthening of \\nexports as demand in China\\u2019s trading partners picks up and as the drag from \\nlast year\\u2019s appreciation of the real trade-weighted renminbi lessens.  We see \\ngrowth then decreasing to about 6\\u00bd percent by the end of the forecast period, \\nin line with our estimate of declining potential growth, and a bit below our \\nMarch Tealbook forecast.    \\nInflation dipped below zero in the first quarter from 1 percent in the fourth \\nquarter.  The decline is primarily due to falling food and fuel prices.  We \\nexpect inflation to rebound to 2\\u00bd percent by the end of the year and to hold at \\nthat pace over the remainder of the forecast period. \\n\\uf0b7 Other Emerging Asia.  We estimate that growth in the rest of emerging Asia \\nedged down to 3\\u00be percent in the first quarter, almost \\u00bd percentage point \\nbelow our March forecast, owing primarily to a widespread decline in exports.  \\nAlthough most of the region\\u2019s economies are estimated to have slowed, \\ngrowth in Korea and Hong Kong appears to have picked up from depressed \\nlevels in the fourth quarter.  With growth in the advanced economies projected \\nto bounce back, we expect the decline in Asian exports to be short-lived and \\nstill see GDP growth in the region rising to 4\\u00bd percent by the end of 2015.  \\nGrowth will also be supported by still-low oil prices and accommodative \\nmonetary policies.  Incoming data suggest that inflation likely bottomed out in \\nthe first quarter at negative \\u00bd percent, largely reflecting the pass-through of \\nlower oil prices.  We see inflation rising to 3\\u00bc percent by 2016.  \\n\\uf0b7 Latin America.  Recent indicators for Mexico suggest growth slowed from \\n2\\u00be percent in the fourth quarter to 2 percent in the first quarter, 1 percentage \\npoint lower than in the March Tealbook.  Mexican manufacturing output and \\nInt\\u2019l Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 41 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nexports through February were weak, consistent with the sharp drop in U.S. \\nmanufacturing production in the first quarter.  Some of that weakness likely \\nwas caused by the labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which disrupted \\nsupply chains, and by the severe U.S. winter weather.  We expect Mexican \\ngrowth to rebound in the current quarter to 2\\u00be percent, in line with the path \\nfor U.S. manufacturing activity, and average about 3\\u00bc percent over the rest of \\nthe forecast period, boosted by the significant depreciation of the peso since \\nmid-2014 and the effect of past economic reforms.  Headline inflation plunged \\nto \\u00bc percent in the first quarter from more than 4 percent in the fourth, owing \\nto a fall in some food and energy prices and the one-off effect of \\ntelecommunications reform.  As the effects of these factors fade, we expect \\ninflation to move up to about 3\\u00bc percent by the second half of this year and \\nstay at that rate thereafter.      \\nReal GDP readings received since the March Tealbook indicate that South \\nAmerican economies grew in aggregate at an annual rate of \\u00bd percent in the \\nfourth quarter.  Chile and Colombia enjoyed solid growth, but Argentina\\u2019s \\neconomy continued to flatline, and Venezuela plunged into recession.  \\nIn Brazil, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 1\\u00bc percent in the fourth quarter, \\nwhich, although meager, was better than we expected.  Growth was supported \\nby strong private consumption, which more than offset a contraction in \\ninvestment and exports.  Despite this positive surprise, we expect GDP to \\ncontract at an annual rate of nearly 2 percent in the first half of this year and to \\nexpand only slightly during the second half.  Domestic demand is held back \\nby the adverse effects on consumer and business confidence of the corruption \\nscandal at Petrobras and the tighter monetary and fiscal policies implemented \\nto combat inflation and restore fiscal discipline.  Next year, we anticipate less \\ndrag from monetary policy and expect confidence to improve.  Accordingly, \\nthe economy should begin to expand, albeit at a subdued 2 percent rate.  \\nInflation increased to an annual rate of 11 percent in the first quarter because \\nof the pass-through from the sizable depreciation of the real and an increase in \\nadministered prices.  As the effects of these factors wane, and with policy \\ninterest rates likely to be kept near their current 12\\u00be percent level, we expect \\ninflation to moderate to 5\\u00be percent next year.  \\n \\nInt\\u2019l Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 42 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n                           \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                            \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nS\\nH\\nA\\nl ti\\nd CEIC\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nInt\\u2019l Econ Devel & Outlook\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 43 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nThe Foreign GDP Outlook                     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nReal GDP*\\nPercent change, annual rate\\n2014\\n2015\\n2016\\n2017\\nH1\\nQ3\\nQ4\\nQ1\\nQ2\\nH2\\n1.

Market participants reportedly \\nfocused on the sizable downward revisions to the projected path of the federal funds rate \\nin the Summary of Economic Projections, as well as downward revisions to participants\\u2019 \\nprojections for inflation, GDP growth, and the longer-run unemployment rate.  Over the \\nremainder of the period, investors further marked down their expected path for short-term \\ninterest rates in response to weaker-than-expected domestic economic data, with the \\ndisappointing March employment report garnering particular attention. \\nOn balance since the March FOMC meeting, the federal funds rates at the end of \\n2016 and end of 2017 implied by OIS quotes have each fallen about 35 basis points.  \\nAccording to the Desk\\u2019s surveys of dealers and market participants, investors now see the \\nSeptember 2015 meeting as the most likely date for the first increase in the federal funds \\nrate target range, and the probability of liftoff at the December 2015 meeting was larger \\nthan that at the June meeting.   \\nNominal Treasury yields out to around 10 years decreased somewhat, consistent \\nwith the more-accommodative-than-expected FOMC communications and generally \\nweak tone of the economic data.  On net, 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields moved down 15, 21, \\nand 13 basis points, respectively.  However, 20- and 30-year yields were relatively little \\nchanged.  \\nOver the intermeeting period, TIPS yields declined more than their nominal \\ncounterparts, as did their associated implied forward rates.  Consistent with the shift in \\nmonetary policy expectations, increases in oil prices, and higher-than-expected February \\nand March CPI reports, the 5-year measure of inflation compensation based on TIPS  \\nmoved up 19 basis points.  The 5-to-10-year TIPS-based forward measure of inflation \\ncompensation rose 9 basis points.

This move was reinforced by positive \\neconomic data in the euro area.  However, the dollar stabilized later in the period.  On net \\nover the intermeeting period, the broad nominal dollar index declined about 2 percent.  \\nAfter appreciating significantly last year and early this year, the real value of the broad \\nU.S. dollar is close to its historical average since 1973.  \\nAFE sovereign yields were modestly lower during the period.  Ten-year yields in \\nthe United Kingdom fell in tandem with those on U.S. Treasury securities, largely \\nbecause of a similar shift in expectations toward later removal of monetary policy \\naccommodation.  German sovereign yields also decreased modestly amid ECB purchases \\nof sovereign debt, despite relatively strong euro-area macroeconomic data releases.  In \\naddition, Swedish and Swiss yield curves declined and are currently negative out through \\n5 years and 10 years, respectively. \\nAFE equity markets, particularly those in the euro area and Japan, slightly \\noutperformed equities in the United States.  A widespread increase in EME equity prices \\nwas reinforced by market perceptions of reduced EME risks, with the recent rise in oil \\nprices appearing to play a role for the major oil exporters.  Equity prices in China and \\nHong Kong moved significantly higher, buoyed in part by monetary policy \\naccommodation and recent deregulation allowing greater flows between the Chinese and \\nHong Kong stock markets. \\nAlthough the Greek government made a timely payment to the IMF on April 9, \\nGreek sovereign spreads continued to widen, as the Greek government struggled to reach \\nan agreement with official creditors ahead of upcoming obligation dates.  Concerns about \\nGreece led Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish sovereign spreads to edge wider, although \\nthey remain quite narrow.  \\nU.S. EQUITY PRICES AND CORPORATE BOND YIELDS \\nOver the intermeeting period, broad U.S. equity price indexes increased slightly, \\non net, as market expectations of more accommodative monetary policy and stabilization \\nof oil prices were partially offset by the on-balance weaker-than-anticipated \\nmacroeconomic news.

Even so, a larger-than-usual \\nfraction of firms has reported earnings above forecasts.  In March, equity analysts \\ncontinued to revise down their forecasts for year-ahead earnings per share for firms in the \\nS&P 500 index, though noticeably less than in the previous two months.  The moderation \\nof the downward revisions likely reflects, in part, the stabilization of the dollar and oil \\nprices (see the box \\u201cEffects of Dollar Appreciation on U.S. Corporate Profits\\u201d).  \\nYields on corporate bonds generally followed Treasury yields down over the \\nintermeeting period.  Spreads of 10-year triple-B-rated corporate bond yields over \\ncomparable-maturity Treasury securities were about unchanged, while yield spreads on \\nspeculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed somewhat.  The narrowing was due, in part, \\nto lower spreads for speculative-grade energy firms, but spreads for those firms remained \\nabove their historical median levels. \\nBUSINESS FINANCE \\nFinancing conditions for nonfinancial businesses continued to be accommodative, \\nand businesses raised substantial amounts of funds in bond, equity, and loan markets, \\nparticularly for M&A and leveraged buyout activities.

Growth of C&I loans on banks\\u2019 books was 12 percent at an annual \\nrate over the same period, consistent with reports from banks in the April SLOOS that \\nthey had experienced increased loan demand from large and middle-market firms and \\nreduced loan pricing.  In the syndicated leveraged loan market, issuance of new money \\nloans slowed in the first quarter relative to its pace over the past year but remained \\nstrong.  However, gross issuance of leveraged loans was considerably smaller over the \\npast two quarters than earlier in 2014, as refinancing activity dropped to its lowest level \\nin a few years.  Even so, CLO issuance in February and March rebounded to near the \\nrobust pace registered during most of the second half of last year.  \\nFinancing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained broadly available for large \\nand small loans and the full range of property types.

In \\npart, this weakness reflects a decline in profits of the energy sector, which have \\nbeen hurt by the decline in oil prices.  The strength of the U.S. dollar has also had \\nan effect.  Dollar appreciation lowers the profits of some U.S. corporations \\nthrough two channels:  (1) If unhedged, profits earned by foreign subsidiaries \\ntranslate into fewer U.S. dollars, and (2) U.S. exports become less competitive \\ncompared with goods produced in other countries.   \\nOver the past several months, equity investors have been factoring the effects of \\ndollar appreciation into their expectations for corporate earnings and portfolio \\nallocation decisions.  The blue line in figure 1 shows the difference between the \\nstock returns of firms with high foreign sales (that is, firms with at least \\n50 percent of revenue earned abroad, directly or through exports) and low \\nforeign sales (that is, firms with less than 20 percent of sales abroad).1  While the \\nshares of firms with high foreign sales underperformed in 2013, their relative \\nperformance worsened as the dollar began to appreciate last summer.  Also, as \\nshown in figure 2, S&P 500 firms with high foreign sales have experienced \\nrelatively large downward revisions to earnings expectations over the past \\nsix months.  \\nThe earnings of U.S. foreign subsidiaries, which account for about 25 percent of \\nthe overall profits of U.S. nonfinancial corporations, declined 7 percent in the \\nfourth quarter of 2014 and are estimated to have declined another 5 percent in \\nthe first quarter of 2015.  To gauge how much of this recent decline in foreign \\nprofits can be accounted for by the strength of the dollar, we use the staff\\u2019s  \\n \\n                                                 \\n1 Firms with high foreign sales tend to be larger and account for almost 75 percent of S&P \\n500 nonfinancial earnings excluding oil and utilities.  We exclude oil firms to isolate the effect \\nof the U.S. dollar.  We also exclude utilities firms because they typically pay high dividends and \\nso their stock returns are typically closely tied to movements in bond markets.  \\nFinancial Developments\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 54 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n  \\n Box ends.\\nforecast model for direct investment receipts, which are roughly equivalent to \\nthe income of foreign subsidiaries.  The model depends on the exchange value of \\nthe dollar, the foreign output gap, and the relative price of imported oil. \\nFigure 3 shows the evolution of direct investment receipts, including the forecast \\nfor 2015.  Direct investment receipts fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 2014 and \\nare projected to fall further in the first quarter of 2015.  Our model attributes \\nabout half of the estimated 12 percent decline in direct investment receipts over \\nthese two quarters to the appreciation of the dollar and about half to the decline \\nin oil prices.  The modest recovery in receipts projected over the remainder of \\n2015 is due in large part to somewhat higher oil prices and a slight narrowing of \\nthe foreign output gap.   \\nOverall, we find that the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar is having a \\nsignificant effect on U.S. firms\\u2019 profits, especially for firms with high foreign \\nsales, and explains roughly half of the recent decline in profits earned from \\nforeign subsidiaries.  \\n \\n \\n  \\nFinancial Developments\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 55 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n        \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n                                                                       \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFinancial Developments\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 56 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nfurther easing of standards on such loans and another strengthening of demand.  In \\naddition, survey respondents indicated that they eased some CRE loan terms over the past \\nyear, and they largely pointed to more aggressive competition, as well as improving \\noutlooks for vacancy rates and property prices, as reasons for doing so.  Indeed, CRE \\nprices continued to rise through the fourth quarter of 2014, supported in part by rising \\nrents and declining vacancy rates as well as by accommodative financing conditions.  \\nMeanwhile, CMBS issuance was about 50 percent higher than in the first quarter of last \\nyear, and spreads of CMBS rates over Treasury swap rates remained narrow.   \\nHOUSEHOLD FINANCE \\nCredit conditions for residential mortgages were generally little changed over the \\nintermeeting period, and lending volumes stayed light.  In the April SLOOS, some large \\nbanks reported having eased standards on GSE-eligible, government-guaranteed, and \\njumbo mortgage loans in the first quarter.  Although house prices rose moderately again \\nin February, the downtrend in the share of mortgages in a negative equity position has \\nflattened somewhat in recent quarters; at 11 to 17 percent, depending on the source, this \\nshare remained elevated relative to pre-crisis levels.   \\nOn balance over the intermeeting period, financing conditions in consumer credit \\nmarkets stayed generally accommodative, and the latest readings on credit performance \\nof consumer debt were little changed.  According to the April SLOOS, bank lending \\nstandards on consumer loans were about unchanged in the first quarter.  Outstanding \\nbalances of auto and student loans continued to expand at a robust pace through \\nFebruary, as such credit remained widely available, including to borrowers with subprime \\ncredit scores.

The \\nfirst operation, on March 19, attracted bids just in excess of the $75 billion offer amount \\nand was allocated at 9 basis points. The second operation, on March 30, offered \\n$125 billion but was undersubscribed and allocated at the maximum rate of 10 basis \\npoints.  In total, take-up of the Federal Reserve\\u2019s term and overnight RRP programs on \\nthis quarter-end ($378 billion) was similar to that on year-end 2014 ($397 billion).3  \\nOverall, the ON RRP and term RRP operations continued to provide a soft floor \\non unsecured money market rates during the intermeeting period, even over quarter-end.  \\nThe federal funds and Eurodollar rates generally stayed within a range of 11 to 13 basis \\npoints, although they dipped to 6 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively, at the \\nMarch quarter-end.4  Quarter-end effects in other unsecured funding markets were also \\nfairly muted.  However, foreign banking organizations\\u2019 reserve balances temporarily \\nfluctuated by $300 billion around quarter-end, continuing a pattern reportedly associated \\nwith the introduction of the Basel III minimum leverage ratio requirement in foreign \\njurisdictions. \\nIn secured markets, temporary funding pressures also were evident at quarter-end. \\nOvernight GCF repo rates for Treasury securities increased more than expected, \\nespecially in the interdealer GCF market.

So \\nfar, their participation has been limited, representing just over $23 billion of the $378 billion take-up at \\nquarter-end. \\n3 At the September 2014 quarter-end, when there were no term RRP operations, $407 billion in \\nbids were received for the $300 billion capped ON RRP operation. \\n4 The effective federal funds rate averaged 12 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the \\nintraday standard deviation averaging 4 basis points. \\nFinancial Developments\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 59 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n                 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n           \\n \\n    \\n \\n                    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                     \\n                             \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\n \\n                   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n \\ng\\n \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          \\n                   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n                     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\nFinancial Developments\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 60 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nhave reflected a reduction in the willingness of some dealers to lend in the repo market \\ndue in part to balance sheet adjustments at quarter-end.

In the first \\nscenario, aggregate demand is persistently weaker than anticipated in the baseline.  In the \\nsecond, the recent lackluster readings on spending and production prove to be more \\ntransitory and the underlying pace of economic activity is stronger than assumed in the \\nbaseline projection, leading to a higher path of inflation.  The third scenario considers the \\npossibility that the trajectory of long-term inflation expectations is lower than in the \\nbaseline, leading to a shallower path of actual inflation in the coming years.  The fourth \\nscenario examines the possibility that the natural rate of unemployment is lower, and \\npotential output grows faster, than in the baseline.  In the fifth scenario, the exit of Greece \\nfrom the euro-area monetary union causes Europe to plunge into a deep recession with \\nsevere adverse effects on global financial conditions and confidence.  The final scenario \\nconsiders the possibility that the broad real dollar appreciates 10 percent relative to the \\nbaseline. \\nWe generate the first, third, and fourth scenarios using the FRB/US model, while \\nthe second one uses the EDO model.  The final two scenarios are generated using the \\nmulticountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its current \\ntarget range, its movements are governed\\u2014as in the baseline forecast\\u2014by an inertial \\nversion of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a \\nmechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in the \\nCommittee\\u2019s recent statements.1  In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of \\nthe SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. \\nPersistent Slowdown in Economic Activity \\nRecent data on consumer spending, housing construction, business investment, \\nand industrial production, as well as the latest employment report, have come in weaker \\nthan anticipated.  In this scenario, we assume that this softness in economic activity turns \\n                                                 \\n1 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the FRB/US and \\nEDO simulations.  One key difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule \\nin SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model\\u2019s estimate \\nof the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.  \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 63 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nAlternative Scenarios\\n(Percent change, annual rate, from end of preceding period except as noted)\\n  2018-\\nMeasure and scenario\\n    H1\\n2015\\nH2\\n  2016\\n  2017\\n  19\\nReal GDP\\nExtended Tealbook baseline\\n1.2  \\n2.4  \\n2.4  \\n2.1  \\n1.8  \\nPersistent slowdown in economic activity\\n.5  \\n.6  \\n.6  \\n1.7  \\n2.5  \\nFaster growth with higher inflation\\n2.1  \\n3.9  \\n3.6  \\n2.0  \\n1.4  \\nLower long-term inflation expectations\\n1.2  \\n2.4  \\n2.4  \\n2.2  \\n1.8  \\nRoom to grow\\n1.4  \\n2.7  \\n3.0  \\n3.2  \\n3.0  \\nGreek exit with severe spillovers \\n.8  \\n.5  \\n1.0  \\n2.2  \\n2.3  \\nStronger dollar \\n1.2  \\n1.8  \\n2.0  \\n2.2  \\n1.9  \\nUnemployment rate1\\nExtended Tealbook baseline\\n5.4  \\n5.3  \\n5.2  \\n5.1  \\n5.1  \\nPersistent slowdown in economic activity\\n5.6  \\n5.8  \\n6.4  \\n6.5  \\n5.8  \\nFaster growth with higher inflation\\n5.2  \\n4.8  \\n4.3  \\n4.4  \\n4.8  \\nLower long-term inflation expectations\\n5.4  \\n5.3  \\n5.2  \\n5.1  \\n5.0  \\nRoom to grow\\n5.4  \\n5.3  \\n5.1  \\n4.8  \\n4.1  \\nGreek exit with severe spillovers \\n5.5  \\n5.6  \\n6.2  \\n6.2  \\n5.9  \\nStronger dollar \\n5.4  \\n5.4  \\n5.5  \\n5.4  \\n5.4  \\nTotal PCE prices\\nExtended Tealbook baseline\\n-.2  \\n1.5  \\n1.6  \\n1.8  \\n1.9  \\nPersistent slowdown in economic activity\\n-.2  \\n1.5  \\n1.6  \\n1.7  \\n1.8  \\nFaster growth with higher inflation\\n-.2  \\n1.7  \\n2.0  \\n2.3  \\n2.4  \\nLower long-term inflation expectations\\n-.3  \\n1.2  \\n1.1  \\n1.2  \\n1.5  \\nRoom to grow\\n-.3  \\n1.3  \\n1.3  \\n1.5  \\n1.7  \\nGreek exit with severe spillovers \\n-.4  \\n.7  \\n.6  \\n1.2  \\n1.7  \\nStronger dollar \\n-.8  \\n1.0  \\n1.4  \\n1.7  \\n1.8  \\nCore PCE prices\\nExtended Tealbook baseline\\n1.2  \\n1.4  \\n1.6  \\n1.8  \\n2.0  \\nPersistent slowdown in economic activity\\n1.2  \\n1.4  \\n1.5  \\n1.7  \\n1.8  \\nFaster growth with higher inflation\\n1.3  \\n1.7  \\n2.0  \\n2.3  \\n2.4  \\nLower long-term inflation expectations\\n1.1  \\n1.1  \\n1.1  \\n1.2  \\n1.5  \\nRoom to grow\\n1.2  \\n1.2  \\n1.3  \\n1.5  \\n1.7  \\nGreek exit with severe spillovers \\n1.1  \\n.9  \\n.7  \\n1.2  \\n1.7  \\nStronger dollar \\n.9  \\n.9  \\n1.3  \\n1.7  \\n1.8  \\nFederal funds rate1\\nExtended Tealbook baseline\\n.1  \\n.4  \\n1.4  \\n2.3  \\n3.2  \\nPersistent slowdown in economic activity\\n.1  \\n.3  \\n.4  \\n.5  \\n1.6  \\nFaster growth with higher inflation\\n.1  \\n.6  \\n2.7  \\n4.2  \\n5.1  \\nLower long-term inflation expectations\\n.1  \\n.4  \\n1.2  \\n1.8  \\n2.7  \\nRoom to grow\\n.1  \\n.1  \\n.3  \\n1.0  \\n2.5  \\nGreek exit with severe spillovers \\n.1  \\n.3  \\n.3  \\n.5  \\n2.0  \\nStronger dollar \\n.1  \\n.3  \\n1.0  \\n1.9  \\n2.9  \\n   1.

In particular, the \\nprojected acceleration in consumer demand and housing construction is delayed relative \\nto the baseline as household confidence in the recovery falters and the pace of household \\nformation remains low.  In turn, these conditions adversely affect profits and business \\nconfidence, causing firms to reduce their investment spending.  \\nReal GDP rises only \\u00bd percent this year and next and 1\\u00be percent in 2017, about \\n1\\u00bc percentage points less than the baseline on average.  The unemployment rate rises to \\n6.5 percent in 2017 before gradually moving back toward its assumed natural rate; \\ninflation is slightly lower than in the baseline projection.  Given this weaker outlook, the \\nfederal funds rate remains at or below 50 basis points until early 2018.  The federal funds \\nrate reaches 1\\u00bd percent by the end of 2019, about 1\\u00be percentage points below baseline. \\nFaster Growth with Higher Inflation \\nWhile much of the incoming data have been lackluster, some forward-looking \\nindicators have remained firm.  In particular, initial claims for unemployment insurance \\nare very low, job openings are elevated, and consumer sentiment remains upbeat.  In this \\nscenario, households\\u2019 and businesses\\u2019 confidence about the underlying strength of the \\neconomy leads them to be more willing to spend and hire than in the baseline, supporting \\na much faster economic expansion.  We also assume that inflation will be more sensitive \\nto reductions in resource slack than in the standard version of the EDO model, consistent \\nwith the estimates of some other DSGE models.2  \\nReal GDP growth averages 4 percent in the second half of 2015 and 3\\u00bd percent in \\n2016, compared with 2\\u00bd percent in the baseline projection.  The unemployment rate falls \\nbelow 5 percent by the end of 2015, bottoms out at 4\\u00bc percent at the beginning of 2017 \\nand then increases slowly for the remainder of the forecast period.  With resource \\nutilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the baseline, reaching almost \\n2\\u00bd percent in 2019.3  The federal funds rate lifts off in the third quarter of 2015, as in the \\nbaseline, but rises more steeply thereafter, passing 4 percent in the second half of 2017 \\nand reaching 5 percent in 2019.  Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate \\n                                                 \\n2 We make inflation more sensitive to slack by reducing the adjustment cost parameters for prices \\nand wages in EDO.  In particular, we use values that are two standard deviations below the EDO point \\nestimates of these two parameters. \\n3 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs for \\nwages and prices in this scenario.  Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation \\nwould have peaked at only a little over 2 percent. \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 65 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n           \\n                                                                                                                                   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n           \\n                                                                                                                                          \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                   \\n \\n            \\n                                                                                                                                       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n         \\n                                                                                                                                   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n           \\n \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 66 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nwould eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring \\ninflation back down to 2 percent. \\nLower Long-Term Inflation Expectations \\nIn the baseline projection, consumer price inflation is projected to increase \\ngradually to the Committee\\u2019s longer-run target of 2 percent.  A key assumption behind \\nthis projection is that the level of long-term inflation expectations relevant for wage and \\nprice setting is currently 1.8 percent and eventually rises to 2 percent.  However, a wide \\nrange of uncertainty surrounds this assumption, and some models the staff consults \\ncurrently point to lower long-term inflation expectations.   \\nIn this scenario, we assume that long-term inflation expectations currently stand at \\n1.5 percent and that, going forward, households and businesses form their expectations \\nadaptively based on past inflation.  The subdued inflation expectations and low actual \\ninflation in the coming years are mutually reinforcing.  As a result, inflation in this \\nscenario runs persistently below the baseline and is only slightly above 1\\u00bd percent in \\n2019.  The federal funds rate increases more slowly after liftoff because of the lower \\ntrajectory of inflation, but given the inertial specification of the policy rule, the path of \\nreal interest rates is roughly unchanged from its baseline trajectory.  As a result, the paths \\nof real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged as well.  \\nRoom to Grow \\nWhile the unemployment rate has come down substantially over the past few \\nyears, inflation has not picked up, with core PCE inflation averaging less than 1\\u00bd percent \\nsince 2012.  One reason wage and price gains have remained modest despite falling \\nunemployment may be that the staff\\u2019s estimate for the natural rate of unemployment is \\ntoo high.  In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has fallen \\nfaster over the past five years than assumed by the staff, to 4.5 percent in the current \\nquarter, and that it continues to fall, reaching 4.2 percent in early 2016, 1 percentage \\npoint less than in the baseline.  This lower trajectory for the natural rate of unemployment \\nis also consistent with the rapid decrease in unemployment seen in recent years given the \\nmodest rates of GDP growth.

This new exhibit touches \\non two broad areas of uncertainty:  first, uncertainty about the current (and past) \\nstate of the economy, informed by revisions to the data, and second, uncertainty \\nabout how the economy will evolve, informed by the staff\\u2019s historical forecast \\nerrors. \\n \\nEmphasizing historical forecast errors has two important benefits.  First, these \\nerrors are conceptually closely related to the uncertainty we want to capture \\naround the current staff forecast.  Second, this procedure requires relatively few \\nassumptions\\u2014chiefly, that forecast errors across time can be meaningfully \\ncombined into a single distribution that will be relevant over the projection period. \\n \\nAnother way that the staff characterizes uncertainty is through stochastic \\nsimulations of the FRB/US model.  (The model-based uncertainty bands will \\ncontinue to be shown in the exhibit illustrating the alternative simulations.)  \\nHowever, these model simulations rely on a specific model that differs in some \\nimportant aspects from the judgmental procedures the staff uses.  In addition, the \\nFRB/US model simulations do not incorporate uncertainty about data revisions. \\n \\nThe top four panels of the new exhibit show fan charts for the key variables of our \\nprojection:  the unemployment rate, GDP growth, and total and core PCE inflation.  \\nEach fan chart includes revision intervals derived from the historical distribution of \\nrevisions to the data.  As shown in the fan charts, uncertainty due to data revisions \\nvaries widely across variables.  For example, because the unemployment rate is not \\nsubject to revision (other than for revised seasonal factors), its revision bands are \\nvery small, whereas the revision bands around past estimates for real GDP growth \\nare much wider. \\n \\nOver the medium-term forecast period, the fan charts show both the 70 percent \\nand 90 percent prediction-interval bands derived from the percentiles of the sizes \\nof past staff forecast errors.1  Note that the standard against which the staff \\nforecasts are evaluated is the latest vintage of the data, so this method will also \\ntake account of the uncertainty resulting from any data revisions following the \\ninitial estimates.  The prediction intervals allow us to make a number of \\n                                                 \\n1 Because we have a limited history of Tealbook projections two years ahead, we extend the \\nprediction-interval bands into 2017 using information from outside forecasters (the date range \\ndenoted as \\u201cAugmented Tealbook\\u201d in the exhibit).  Specifically, we use forecasts from the CEA, \\nCBO, and Blue Chip consensus, and we assume that any forecast deterioration from one to two \\nyears ahead would apply equally to the Tealbook projections.  To reflect that change in \\nprocedures, we separate the bands for 2016 and 2017 with a second dashed line (and we do not \\nextend the band for core PCE inflation because of limited data on outside forecasts of core \\ninflation). \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 70 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nobservations about the staff\\u2019s historical forecast record.  For example, for the \\nunemployment rate, the median staff forecast error one year ahead is negative\\u2014\\nthe median lies slightly below the forecast line\\u2014because the historical forecasts \\nhave been too high slightly more often than they have been too low.  However, the \\ngreen band around the same forecast extends much higher above the forecast line \\nthan below it, because rare large misses to the upside have been much larger in \\nmagnitude than rare large misses to the downside. \\n \\nWe use Tealbook forecasts from 1980 to 2014 for computing prediction intervals for \\nGDP growth and the unemployment rate but the shorter range of 1998 to 2014 for \\nour inflation measures.  The shorter range for the inflation measures, during which \\ninflation outcomes have fallen in a much smaller range over the past near-two \\ndecades than previously, reflects our judgment that this is the period that is most \\nrelevant for assessing the amount of uncertainty surrounding our inflation \\nprojections.2 \\n \\nTo the right of each of the four fan charts is the historical distribution of the \\ncorresponding series over the time period we deem most useful for assessing \\nuncertainty.  Comparing the staff projections in the fan charts with these historical \\ndistributions can aid in the interpretation of the prediction-interval bands.  For \\nexample, by 2017 the staff forecast of the unemployment rate is low, and therefore \\nthe unconditional 90 percent confidence range placed around it dips below the \\nlowest reading since 1980.  This result suggests that a 90 percent range conditional \\non other factors, such as the state of the economy, would likely not extend down \\nas low as shown in the fan chart. \\n \\nThe results in the upper fan charts rely crucially on the assumption that the \\nhistorical periods chosen for calculating the distribution of forecast errors in the fan \\ncharts are relevant for the forecast period.  To provide some perspective, at the \\nbottom of the exhibit, the distributions of the actual history of the four series are \\nshown for three time periods.  A few points jump out.  First, the intervals for \\nsamples that extend back to 1930 are considerably wider than those based on \\npost\\u2013World War II data, illustrating that large tail events can fall well outside our \\ncurrent estimates of likely outcomes.  Second, the historical realizations of GDP \\ngrowth and the unemployment rate from 1980 to 2014, the period over which we \\ncompute the staff forecast errors, look roughly similar to the realizations for the \\nentire period following World War II.  Finally, as noted previously, the distribution \\nof inflation outcomes has been much more compressed in recent years, and while \\nwe believe this recent period provides the more appropriate guide to the future, \\nwe cannot be certain that is so. \\n                                                 \\n2 The beginning date of 1998 for this shorter range was chosen based on the availability of \\ndata on staff forecast errors for core PCE inflation.  The date range used for inflation is too short \\nto provide enough data to construct meaningful 90 percent (green) bands for core or total PCE \\ninflation, and therefore no 90 percent bands are shown for the inflation measures. \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 71 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nInflation rises more slowly than in the baseline, reflecting both greater resource \\nslack and faster productivity growth.4  Core PCE inflation reaches only 1\\u00be percent at the \\nend of 2019.  The federal funds rate remains at its current target range for an additional \\nyear, lifting off in the third quarter of 2016.  The unemployment rate continues falling \\nafter 2016, reaching its natural rate in the first half of 2019 and moving below it \\nthereafter.  As a result of a combination of higher structural productivity and more-\\naccommodative monetary policy, real GDP growth picks up, averaging about 3 percent \\nover the 2016\\u201319 period.5 \\nGreek Exit with Severe Spillovers \\nOur baseline assumption is that the European authorities will keep spillovers from \\ndevelopments in Greece reasonably contained, even in the event that debt negotiations \\nbreak down completely and Greece\\u2019s crisis deepens.  However, it is far from assured that \\nthe firewalls erected during the past few years\\u2014and aggressive actions that the \\nauthorities would presumably take to limit contagion\\u2014will succeed in containing the \\ncrisis to Greece, especially if Greece actually leaves the euro area.  In this scenario, we \\nconsider a more dire outcome in which Greece abandons the euro and causes the euro \\narea to plunge into a deep recession with severe adverse effects on global financial \\nconditions and confidence.  \\nSpecifically, our scenario assumes that financial conditions in the euro area \\ntighten sharply and that confidence plummets amid rising unemployment and heightened \\ndisinflationary pressures.  Peripheral sovereign spreads rise 400 basis points above \\nbaseline while euro-area corporate borrowing spreads rise more than 200 basis points.  As \\na result, euro-area real GDP falls about 6 percent relative to the baseline by the end of \\n2016.  The euro-area crisis has substantial adverse spillovers to the United States.  U.S. \\ncorporate bond spreads are assumed to rise about 100 basis points, while flight-to-safety \\nflows cause the trade-weighted dollar to increase nearly 8 percent and depress 10-year \\n                                                 \\n4 A higher path of productivity holds down marginal costs of production, which are a key \\ndeterminant of inflation in FRB/US and many other macroeconomic models. \\n5 In this scenario, policymakers are aware of the faster structural productivity growth.  If \\npolicymakers instead learned about the faster structural productivity growth only gradually, and thus the \\nstance of the federal funds rate was tighter than they would have implemented if fully informed, real GDP \\ngrowth would be \\u00bc percentage point lower and inflation would be 10 basis points lower, on average, \\nthrough 2019 than in the original scenario.  In this case, the unemployment rate would decline to only  \\n4\\u00bd percent at the end of 2019. \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 72 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nTreasury yields about 25 basis points.  Credit conditions tighten even more in the EMEs, \\nand their currencies depreciate substantially against the dollar.  \\nWeaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall \\nrelative to the baseline.  Given that U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to the \\nbaseline as a result of lower confidence and weaker financial conditions, U.S. real GDP \\nexpands only \\u00bd percent in the second half of 2015 and 1 percent in 2016.  Lower \\ndomestic demand and lower import price inflation cause U.S. core inflation to run at \\nabout \\u00be percent in 2016, about 1 percentage point below baseline.  The inertial Taylor \\nrule prescribes a substantially shallower path for the federal funds rate than in the \\nbaseline. \\nStronger Dollar \\nThe broad real dollar has depreciated about 2 percent since the March Tealbook, \\nand in our baseline we project that the dollar will resume its appreciation going forward, \\nrising around 3 percent before flattening out in early 2016.  However, the dollar may rise \\nconsiderably faster for any number of reasons, including a greater-than-expected reaction \\nby investors to the prospective normalization of policy rates in the United States or \\nheightened concern about the foreign outlook.  In this scenario, we examine the \\npossibility that the broad real dollar appreciates 10 percent relative to the baseline in the \\ncurrent quarter.6   \\nThe stronger dollar reduces U.S. real net exports substantially and also pushes \\ndown inflation as a result of lower import prices and greater resource slack.  \\nConsequently, even though the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound \\nat the same time as in the baseline, U.S. monetary policy accommodation is removed \\nmore gradually going forward, with the federal funds rate in 2016 about 50 basis points \\nbelow the baseline path.  The more accommodative policy stance provides a boost to U.S. \\ndomestic demand and helps reduce the adverse effect of the stronger dollar on real \\nactivity.  Even so, U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of only 2 percent in 2016\\u2014about \\n\\u00bd percentage point below the baseline\\u2014and the unemployment rate remains at \\n5\\u00bd percent.  Lower import prices and greater resource slack cause core PCE inflation to \\nrun about \\u00bd percentage point below baseline in the second half of this year before \\ngradually reverting to the baseline thereafter. \\n                                                 \\n6 This scenario is identical to the one presented in the box \\u201cThe Effect of the Dollar on U.S. Core \\nImport and Consumer Prices\\u201d in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section. \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 73 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nAssessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks (1)\\nProbability of Inflation Events \\n(4 quarters ahead\\u20142016:Q1)\\nProbability that the 4-quarter change in total \\nPCE prices will be ...\\nStaff\\nFRB/US\\nEDO\\nBVAR\\nGreater than 3 percent\\nCurrent Tealbook\\n.06\\n.06\\n.15\\n.00\\nPrevious Tealbook\\n.05\\n.05\\n.11\\n.00\\nLess than 1 percent\\nCurrent Tealbook\\n.24\\n.21\\n.22\\n.64\\nPrevious Tealbook\\n.26\\n.22\\n.28\\n.65\\nProbability of Unemployment Events \\n(4 quarters ahead\\u20142016:Q1)\\nProbability that the unemployment rate will...\\nStaff\\nFRB/US\\nEDO\\nBVAR\\nIncrease by 1 percentage point\\nCurrent Tealbook\\n.03\\n.02\\n.24\\n.00\\nPrevious Tealbook\\n.02\\n.02\\n.23\\n.00\\nDecrease by 1 percentage point\\nCurrent Tealbook\\n.13\\n.09\\n.04\\n.40\\nPrevious Tealbook\\n.18\\n.17\\n.04\\n.53\\nProbability of Near-Term Recession\\nProbability that real GDP declines in \\neach of 2015:Q2 and 2015:Q3\\nStaff\\nFRB/US\\nEDO\\nBVAR\\nFactor\\nModel\\nCurrent Tealbook\\n.05\\n.02\\n.03\\n.03\\n.30\\nPrevious Tealbook\\n.04\\n.02\\n.02\\n.01\\n.13\\nNote: \\u201cStaff\\u201d represents Tealbook forecast errors applied to the Tealbook baseline; baselines for FRB/US, BVAR, EDO, and \\nthe factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate.

(The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for \\nthose years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property \\nproducts from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the \\ncore PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the \\u201cfood away from home\\u201d component for years \\nbefore it was included in core.)   \\nThe historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described \\nabove) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show \\nthe highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the \\npage, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the \\nuse of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data \\ngoing back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the \\nconventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment \\nrate from 1930 to 1946.1 \\nThe prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from \\nhistorical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the \\nunemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding \\npercentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for \\n1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff \\nforecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the mid-\\n1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further \\nback.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the \\nerrors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding \\nthe green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the \\nprediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful \\n90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that \\nforecast errors were positive more than half of the time. \\n                                                 \\n1 Stanley Lebergott (1957), \\u201cAnnual Estimates of Unemployment in the United States,  \\n1900\\u20131954,\\u201d in National Bureau of Economic Research, The Measurement and Behavior of Unemployment \\n(Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press), pp. 213\\u201341. \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 77 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\n \\n \\n \\nBecause the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the \\nintervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection \\nerrors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of \\nEconomic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction \\nintervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the \\nchange in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and \\napply the average change to the staff\\u2019s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any \\ndeterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside \\nforecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data \\nmean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside \\nprojections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or \\nannual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on \\nforecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not \\nextrapolate the staff\\u2019s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. \\nThe intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of \\ndata revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as \\nof the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published \\nestimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into \\ndistributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created. \\n \\nRisks & Uncertainty\\nClass II FOMC - Restricted (FR)\\nApril 22, 2015\\nPage 78 of 92\\nAuthorized for Public Release\\nChanges in GDP, Prices, and Unemployment\\n(Percent, annual rate except as noted)\\nNominal GDP\\nReal GDP            \\n \\nPCE price index              \\n     Core PCE price index   Unemployment rate1\\nInterval\\n03/11/15\\n04/22/15\\n03/11/15\\n04/22/15\\n03/11/15\\n04/22/15\\n03/11/15\\n04/22/15\\n03/11/15\\n04/22/15\\nQuarterly\\n2014:Q1\\n-.8\\n-.8\\n-2.1\\n-2.1\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n6.6\\n6.6\\n         Q2\\n6.8\\n6.8\\n4.6\\n4.6\\n2.3\\n2.3\\n2.0\\n2.0\\n6.2\\n6.2\\n         Q3\\n6.4\\n6.4\\n5.0\\n5.0\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n6.1\\n6.1\\n         Q4\\n2.1\\n2.4\\n2.1\\n2.2\\n-.4\\n-.4\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n5.7\\n5.7\\n2015:Q1\\n1.7\\n.3\\n1.7\\n.1\\n-2.0\\n-2.0\\n.8\\n.8\\n5.5\\n5.6\\n         Q2\\n4.8\\n4.6\\n2.6\\n2.4\\n1.3\\n1.5\\n1.4\\n1.6\\n5.3\\n5.4\\n         Q3\\n3.9\\n3.7\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n1.5\\n1.5\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n5.2\\n5.3\\n         Q4\\n4.1\\n4.2\\n2.4\\n2.4\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n1.4\\n5.2\\n5.3\\n2016:Q1\\n4.2\\n4.3\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n1.6\\n5.1\\n5.3\\n         Q2\\n4.0\\n4.1\\n2.2\\n2.3\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n5.1\\n5.2\\n         Q3\\n4.0\\n4.2\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n5.1\\n5.2\\n         Q4\\n4.0\\n4.2\\n2.3\\n2.5\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n5.1\\n5.2\\nTwo-quarter2\\n2014:Q2\\n2.9\\n2.9\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n1.9\\n1.9\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n-.8\\n-.8\\n         Q4\\n4.3\\n4.4\\n3.5\\n3.6\\n.4\\n.4\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n-.5\\n-.5\\n2015:Q2\\n3.3\\n2.4\\n2.2\\n1.2\\n-.3\\n-.2\\n1.1\\n1.2\\n-.4\\n-.3\\n         Q4\\n4.0\\n3.9\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n1.5\\n1.4\\n-.1\\n-.1\\n2016:Q2\\n4.1\\n4.2\\n2.3\\n2.3\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n-.1\\n-.1\\n         Q4\\n4.0\\n4.2\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n.0\\n.0\\nFour-quarter3\\n2013:Q4\\n4.6\\n4.6\\n3.1\\n3.1\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n-.8\\n-.8\\n2014:Q4\\n3.6\\n3.7\\n2.4\\n2.4\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n-1.3\\n-1.3\\n2015:Q4\\n3.6\\n3.2\\n2.2\\n1.8\\n.6\\n.6\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n-.5\\n-.4\\n2016:Q4\\n4.1\\n4.2\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n-.1\\n-.1\\n2017:Q4\\n3.9\\n4.0\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n1.9\\n1.8\\n1.8\\n1.8\\n-.1\\n-.1\\nAnnual\\n2013\\n3.7\\n3.7\\n2.2\\n2.2\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n7.4\\n7.4\\n2014\\n3.9\\n3.9\\n2.4\\n2.4\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n6.2\\n6.2\\n2015\\n3.7\\n3.3\\n2.6\\n2.2\\n.3\\n.3\\n1.2\\n1.3\\n5.3\\n5.4\\n2016\\n4.1\\n4.2\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n1.5\\n5.1\\n5.2\\n2017\\n4.0\\n4.1\\n2.2\\n2.3\\n1.8\\n1.7\\n1.7\\n1.7\\n5.0\\n5.1\\n1.

Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.\\n    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.\\n    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff\\u2019s measure of potential output and the\\nnatural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.\\n    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).

The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Committee regarding the management of the foreign currency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authorization.6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to conduct testing of transactions for the purpose of operational readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization.By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Program for Security of FOMC Information.In the Committee's annual reconsideration of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the reference to the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent. All participants supported the statement with the revision, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement.STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY(As amended effective January 29, 2019)The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market.These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.4 percent.In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market OperationsThe deputy manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided an overview of developments in U.S. and global financial markets. Financial markets were quite volatile over the intermeeting period. Market participants pointed to a number of factors as contributing to the heightened volatility and sustained declines in risk asset prices and interest rates over recent months including a weaker outlook and greater uncertainties for foreign economies (particularly for Europe and China), perceptions of greater policy risks, and the partial shutdown of the federal government. Against this backdrop, market participants appeared to interpret FOMC communications at the time of the December meeting as not fully appreciating the tightening of financial conditions and the associated downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook that had emerged since the fall. In addition, some market reports suggested that investors perceived the FOMC to be insufficiently flexible in its approach to adjusting the path for the federal funds rate or the process for balance sheet normalization in light of those risks. The deterioration in risk sentiment late in December was reportedly amplified by poor liquidity and thin trading conditions around year-end.Early in the new year, market sentiment improved following communications by Federal Reserve officials emphasizing that the Committee could be \\\"patient\\\" in considering further adjustments to the stance of policy and that it would be flexible in managing the reduction of securities holdings in the SOMA. On balance, stock prices finished the period up almost 5 percent while corporate risk spreads narrowed, reversing a portion of the changes in these variables since the September FOMC meeting.The deputy manager reported results from the Open Market Desk's latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants. Regarding the outlook for policy, the median path for the federal funds rate among respondents had shifted down about 25 basis points relative to the responses from the surveys conducted ahead of the December meeting. Moreover, the average probability that respondents attached to an increase in the target range as the next policy action declined and the corresponding probabilities they attached to the possibility that the target range would be unchanged or lowered at some point this year increased. Concerning expectations for the FOMC statement, many survey respondents anticipated the retention of language pointing to the likelihood of \\\"some further gradual increases\\\" in the target range for the federal funds rate but many also expected the statement to emphasize patience or data dependence in the conduct of policy. Consistent with recent communications that the FOMC would be flexible in its approach to balance sheet normalization, the survey results also suggested that the respondents anticipated that the Committee would slow the balance sheet runoff in scenarios that involved a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate.In reviewing money market developments, the deputy manager noted that federal funds continued to trade at rates close to the interest on excess reserves rate. Moreover, no signs of reserve scarcity were evident in the behavior of the federal funds rate; the correlation between daily changes in reserve balances and the federal funds rate remained close to zero. In other markets, repurchase agreement (repo) rates spiked at year-end, reportedly reflecting strong demands for financing from dealers associated with large Treasury auction net settlements on that day combined with a cutback in the supply of financing available from banks and others managing the size of their balance sheets over year-end for reporting purposes. The deputy manager noted that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was planning to release a notice in early February for public comment on plans to include new data on selected deposits in the calculation of the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR). In addition, the staff had begun work aimed at publishing a series of backward-looking average secured overnight financing rates (SOFR) as a further step to support reference rate reform. The staff planned to solicit public feedback on this effort later this year and initiate publication of these averages by the first half of 2020.Following the briefing, participants raised a number of questions about market reports that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet runoff and associated \\\"quantitative tightening\\\" had been an important factor contributing to the selloff in equity markets in the closing months of last year. While respondents assessed that the reduction of securities held in the SOMA would put some modest upward pressure on Treasury yields and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) yields over time, they generally placed little weight on balance sheet reduction as a prime factor spurring the deterioration in risk sentiment over that period. However, some other investors reportedly held firmly to the belief that the runoff of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings was a factor putting significant downward pressure on risky asset prices, and the investment decisions of these investors, particularly in thin market conditions around the year-end, might have had an outsized effect on market prices for a time. Participants also discussed the hypothesis that investors may have taken some signal about the future path of the federal funds rate based on perceptions that the Federal Reserve was unwilling to adjust the pace of balance sheet runoff in light of economic and financial developments.By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk's domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System's account during the intermeeting period.Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation FrameworksCommittee participants resumed their discussion from the December 2018 meeting of the appropriate long-run framework for monetary policy implementation. At the January meeting, the staff provided briefings on the effectiveness and efficiency of the Committee's current operating regime and on options for transitioning to the longer-run size of the balance sheet.The staff noted that the Committee had previously indicated that, in the longer run, it intends to operate with no more securities holdings than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. In considering the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff observed that over recent years, the Federal Reserve had been able to implement monetary policy in an environment with ample reserves by adjusting administered rates--including the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility--without needing to actively manage the supply of reserves. Over this period, the effective federal funds rate was generally steady at levels well within the Committee's target range despite substantial changes in the level of reserves in the banking system and significant changes in money markets, regulations, and financial institutions' business models. In addition, other money market rates generally moved closely with the federal funds rate. The current regime was therefore effective both in providing control of the policy rate and in ensuring transmission of the policy stance to other rates and broader financial markets.The staff briefing also included a discussion of factors relevant in judging the level of reserves that would support the efficient implementation of monetary policy. The staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate. The aggregate level of reserves had already declined by $1.2 trillion from a peak level of $2.8 trillion reached in October 2014; the decline stemmed from both reductions in asset holdings and increases in nonreserve liabilities such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation. Some recent survey information and other evidence suggested that reserves might begin to approach an efficient level later this year. Against this backdrop, the staff presented options for substantially slowing the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time so that the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual pace reflecting the trend growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities.The staff also described options for communicating plans both for the operating regime and for the completion of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet. If the Committee reached a decision to continue using its current operating regime, announcing this decision after the current meeting would help reduce uncertainty about both the long-run implementation framework and the likely evolution of the balance sheet. In addition, the Committee could revise its previous communications to make clear that it was flexible in its approach to normalizing the balance sheet and was prepared to change the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to support the FOMC's broader policy goals. The staff noted that, after the end of asset redemptions, the Desk could reinvest principal payments received from holdings of agency MBS in Treasury securities as directed.Participants noted some of the key advantages of the Federal Reserve's current operating regime, including good control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and good transmission to other money market rates and broader financial markets. They observed that a regime that controlled the policy rate through active management of the supply of reserves likely would have disadvantages. In particular, the level and variability of reserve demand and supply were likely to be much larger than in the period before the crisis, and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations. Participants judged that, in light of their extensive previous discussions, it was now appropriate to provide the public with more certainty that the Federal Reserve would continue to use its current operating regime. Choosing an operating regime would also allow the Committee to move forward on related issues, including plans for concluding the normalization of the size of the balance sheet. Participants emphasized the importance of describing their chosen operating regime in clear terms to enhance public understanding.Participants discussed market commentary that suggested that the process of balance sheet normalization might be influencing financial markets. Participants noted that the ongoing reduction in the Federal Reserve's asset holdings had proceeded smoothly for more than a year, with no significant effects on financial markets. The gradual reduction in securities holdings had been announced well in advance and, as intended, was proceeding largely in the background, with the federal funds rate remaining the Committee's primary tool for adjusting the stance of policy. Nonetheless, some investors might have interpreted previous communications as indicating that a very high threshold would have to be met before the Committee would be willing to adjust its balance sheet normalization plans. Participants observed that, although the target range for the federal funds rate was the Committee's primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, the balance sheet normalization process should proceed in a way that supports the achievement of the Federal Reserve's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Consistent with this principle, participants agreed that it was important to be flexible in managing the process of balance sheet normalization, and that it would be appropriate to adjust the details of balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to achieve the Committee's macroeconomic objectives.Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve's asset holdings later this year. Such an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. A substantial majority expected that when asset redemptions ended, the level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than necessary for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy; if so, many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves, reflecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation, could be appropriate. In these participants' view, this process would allow the Federal Reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of reserves while maintaining good control of short-term interest rates without needing to engage in more frequent open market operations. A few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing reserves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs, such as an undue risk of volatility in short-term interest rates, that would exceed its benefits. These participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions, the Federal Reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in nonreserve liabilities, so as to keep the average level of reserves relatively stable. A couple of participants suggested that a ceiling facility to mitigate temporary unexpected pressures in reserve markets could play a useful role in supporting policy implementation at lower levels of reserves.Participants commented that, in light of the Committee's longstanding plan to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long run, it would be appropriate once asset redemptions end to reinvest most, if not all, principal payments received from agency MBS in Treasury securities. Some thought that continuing to reinvest agency MBS principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month in agency MBS, as under the current balance sheet normalization plan, would simplify communications or provide a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large declines in long-term interest rates caused agency MBS prepayment speeds to increase sharply. However, some others judged that retaining the cap on agency MBS redemptions was unnecessary at this stage in the normalization process. These participants noted considerations in support of this view, including that principal payments were unlikely to reach the $20 billion level after 2019, that the cap could slightly slow the return to a portfolio of primarily Treasury securities, or that the Committee would have the flexibility to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments. Participants commented that it would be important over time to develop and communicate plans for reinvesting agency MBS principal payments, and they expected to continue their discussion of balance sheet normalization and related issues at upcoming meetings.Following the discussion, the Chairman proposed that the Committee communicate its intentions regarding monetary policy implementation and its willingness to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting. All participants agreed with the proposed statement.STATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION(Adopted January 30, 2019)After extensive deliberations and thorough review of experience to date, the Committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run. Additionally, the Committee is revising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program.5Accordingly, all participants agreed to the following:The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.Staff Review of the Economic SituationThe information available for the January 29-30 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen and that growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, although the availability of data was more limited than usual because of the partial federal government shutdown that extended from December 22 to January 25. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0091month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was a bit below 2 percent in November, held down in part by recent declines in consumer energy prices. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed.Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in December. The national unemployment rate edged up but was still at a low level of 3.9 percent, while the labor force participation rate also increased somewhat; as a result, the employment-to-population ratio remained steady in December. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in December were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, although persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons continued to be close to the lows reached in late 2007. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits edged down in November but were still at high levels; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through the middle of January were near historically low levels. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in December.Industrial production increased solidly in December. Output gains were strong in the manufacturing and mining sectors, while the output of utilities declined, with warmer-than-usual temperatures lowering the demand for heating. Automakers' assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would ease somewhat in the first quarter, although new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in overall factory output in the coming months.Household spending looked to have increased strongly in the fourth quarter, as real PCE growth was strong in October and November. The release of the retail sales report for December was delayed, but available indicators--such as credit card and debit card transaction data and light motor vehicle sales--suggested that household spending growth remained strong in December. Key factors that influence consumer spending--including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and still-elevated measures of households' net worth--continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was less upbeat in early January than it had been last year but remained at a generally favorable level.Real residential investment appeared to have declined again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part decreases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing, though somewhat slower, house price appreciation. Data on starts and permits for new residential construction in December were not available, but building permit issuance for new single-family homes--which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction of such homes--had moved down modestly in the previous couple of months. Sales of existing homes decreased, on net, over November and December, while data on new home sales for those two months were delayed.Growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property looked to have picked up solidly in the fourth quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose, on balance, in October and November, while information on shipments for December was delayed; available indicators of transportation equipment spending in the fourth quarter were strong. Forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending--such as orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and readings on business sentiment--pointed to somewhat slower spending gains in the near term. Data on nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector in November were not available. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation--an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector--was roughly flat in December and through most of January.Total real government purchases appeared to have increased moderately in the fourth quarter. Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for December were delayed. The partial federal government shutdown restrained real federal purchases somewhat in the fourth quarter and likely had a more significant negative effect on federal purchases in the first quarter. Real purchases by state and local governments looked to have risen modestly in the fourth quarter, as the payrolls of those governments expanded a bit over that period. Nominal state and local construction spending had risen solidly in October, but construction data for November were delayed.Data on U.S. international trade for November and December also were delayed. The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations--including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk's Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants--were little changed.Recent data suggested that foreign economic growth was subdued in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), especially the euro area, indicators of economic activity weakened further, though they remained consistent with positive economic growth. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), growth in Mexico and Brazil appeared to have slowed to a modest pace in the fourth quarter after a temporary pickup in the third quarter. The Chinese economy expanded at a slower pace than earlier in the year amid notable weakness in household spending, and Chinese imports from other emerging Asian economies turned down. Foreign inflation fell in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting lower oil prices. Inflation pressures, especially in some AFEs, generally remained muted.Staff Review of the Financial SituationInvestor risk sentiment fluctuated materially over the intermeeting period. A variety of factors--including FOMC communications, weaker-than-expected data, trade policy uncertainties, the partial federal government shutdown, and concerns about the outlook for corporate earnings--were cited by market participants as contributing to a deterioration in risk sentiment early in the period. During this time, broad equity indexes declined substantially amid a sharp rise in financial market volatility, and corporate bond spreads widened notably. Subsequently, positive signals regarding trade policy, robust economic data releases, and communications from FOMC participants led to an improvement in risk sentiment. On net, the S&P 500 index rose, option-implied volatility--the VIX--fell, Treasury yields declined, and corporate spreads narrowed over the intermeeting period. Despite the intermeeting moves in financial markets, financial conditions remained notably tighter than in September 2018. Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit further over the intermeeting period but remained generally supportive of spending.December FOMC communications were reportedly perceived by market participants as not fully appreciating the implications of tighter financial conditions and softening global data over recent months for the U.S. economic outlook. Subsequent communications from FOMC participants were interpreted as suggesting that the FOMC would be patient in assessing the implications of recent economic and financial developments. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2019 was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and investors continued to expect no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at the January FOMC meeting. The market-implied path for 2020 shifted down somewhat.Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated substantially, with heightened risk aversion contributing to a significant decline in yields early in the intermeeting period. Subsequently, yields rose, though 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields still ended the period somewhat lower, on net. The spread between the yields on nominal 10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed over the period, and remained in the lower end of its historical range over recent decades. The near-term forward spread--the difference between the current implied three-month forward rate at a horizon six quarters ahead (derived from the Treasury yield curve) and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill--narrowed, on net, and also was in the lower end of its historical distribution. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year-forward inflation compensation measures based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged down a bit over the period; both measures were down significantly from levels prevailing in the fall of last year.In U.S. risky asset markets, the S&P 500 equity index was down as much as 8 percent at one point during the period but ended the period notably higher. On net, the VIX fell substantially while corporate bond spreads narrowed a bit.The federal funds rate and other overnight funding rates rose following the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December FOMC meeting. Year-end pressures in repo markets were reportedly exacerbated by a high volume of settlements of Treasury securities against a backdrop of large dealer inventories and reduced intermediation by global systemically important banks. General collateral repo rates moved up sharply at year-end but subsequently returned to normal levels.Foreign financial markets followed the same general pattern as those in the United States. On balance, foreign equity prices moved up moderately and sovereign credit spreads in EMEs narrowed. Moreover, inflows to dedicated emerging market funds resumed after two quarters of outflows. Longer-term sovereign yields in AFEs edged lower on net.The dollar depreciated broadly amid falling U.S. yields and greater investor optimism about prospects for some EMEs. The dollar depreciated notably against the British pound, on net, as market participants reportedly saw an increased likelihood of a delay in the Brexit process. The dollar also depreciated considerably against the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso following progress on pension reform in Brazil and a fiscal announcement in Mexico that was perceived as prudent.Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms tightened somewhat, on balance. Gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed considerably in December across the credit rating spectrum but rebounded in January. Even so, the volume of high-yield bonds issued by nonfinancial firms remained well below its average over the past few years. Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds were volatile but narrowed a bit, on net, and stayed at levels well above those that prevailed a year ago. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of deterioration, although actual corporate bond defaults remained low overall. Institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed in December to its lowest level since July 2016, as loan spreads widened substantially. Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net.Private-sector analysts significantly revised down their projections for corporate earnings for the fourth quarter and for 2019 as a whole. The pace of gross equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings was sluggish in December, amid reports that several firms may have pushed back initial equity offerings.Respondents to the January 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that lending standards for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans remained basically unchanged in the fourth quarter, after having reported easing standards over the past several quarters. Growth of C&I loans on banks' balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced paydowns and loan sales.In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions remained accommodative. Although commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) spreads were volatile, they were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, and issuance of both agency and non-agency CMBS remained strong. CRE loan growth at banks continued to expand at a pace comparable with that seen over the course of 2018. Banks in the January SLOOS reported that demand was unchanged, on net, in the fourth quarter for nonfarm nonresidential loans, the largest CRE loan category, while demand was reportedly weaker for multifamily loans and construction loans. On balance, banks reported tightening their standards for all types of CRE loans in the fourth quarter.Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained accommodative for most borrowers. Purchase mortgage origination activity continued to decline modestly through November, while refinancing activity continued to be muted.In consumer credit markets, financing conditions tightened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive of growth in household spending. Banks reported in the SLOOS that they tightened credit card lending standards during the fourth quarter. In the consumer asset-backed securities market, spreads widened somewhat amid broad market volatility.The staff provided an update on its views with respect to potential risks to financial stability. The increase in financial market volatility seen over the fall of last year was characterized as a return to historically more typical levels, following the historically low-volatility environment that persisted through much of 2017 and 2018. However, the increase in volatility in financial markets in December was viewed as substantial and as likely exacerbated by thin year-end liquidity, among other factors. Staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets to have abated somewhat in the period since the assessment presented in the November 2018 financial stability report. Staff continued to monitor developments in the leveraged loan market given the sharp rise in spreads and slowdown in issuance late last year. The build-up in overall nonfinancial business debt to levels close to historical highs relative to GDP was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector. Staff continued to judge risks associated with household-sector debt as moderate. Both the risks associated with financial leverage and the vulnerabilities related to maturity transformation were viewed as being low, as they have been for some time.Staff Economic OutlookThe U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was revised down a little, on balance, primarily reflecting somewhat lower projected paths for domestic equity prices and foreign economic growth. The staff estimated that U.S. real GDP growth was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, bolstered by consumer spending and business investment, and that the effects of the partial federal government shutdown were quite small in that quarter. Real GDP growth was expected to slow but remain solid in the first half of this year, with the effects of the partial federal government shutdown modestly restraining GDP growth in the first quarter and those effects being reversed in the second quarter. In the medium term, real GDP growth in 2019 was forecast to be at a rate above the staff's estimate of potential output growth, step down to the growth rate of potential output next year and then slow further to a pace below potential output growth in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to decline somewhat further below the staff's estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021. With labor market conditions judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate.The staff's forecast for inflation was little revised for the January FOMC meeting. Core PCE price inflation was still expected to step up to 2 percent over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term. Total PCE price inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation this year and next, reflecting projected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the same level as core inflation in 2021.The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated.Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic OutlookParticipants agreed that over the intermeeting period the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had remained near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years. Participants generally continued to expect the growth rate of real GDP in 2019 to step down somewhat from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate closer to their estimates of longer-run growth, with a few participants commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to contribute to the step-down. Several participants commented that they had nudged down their outlooks for output growth since the December meeting, citing a softening in consumer or business sentiment, a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth, or the tightening in financial conditions that had occurred in recent months.In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that recent data on spending had been strong, supported by a strong job market and rising incomes. A couple of participants commented that contacts in their Districts remained optimistic about consumer spending. However, some participants noted the recent softening in surveys of consumer sentiment. Participants observed that the recent partial federal government shutdown had presented a significant hardship for many families. A few participants also pointed to continued weakness in the housing sector, which was attributed in part to concerns about affordability among potential homebuyers.Participants noted that growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. Some participants highlighted that recent surveys of business sentiment or District contacts had indicated some weakening in optimism or confidence about the economic outlook, though available indicators suggested that the level of business sentiment had remained high. Concerns about the economic outlook were variously attributed to uncertainty or worries about slowing global economic growth, including in Europe and China; trade policy; waning fiscal policy stimulus; and the partial government shutdown. Manufacturing contacts in a number of Districts indicated that such factors were causing them to delay or defer capital expenditures. In addition, a few participants noted that recent declines in oil or gasoline prices had damped plans for capital expenditures in the energy sector. A few participants observed that conditions in the agricultural sector remained difficult, citing large inventories of agricultural commodities, uncertainty about international trade policies, and concerns regarding low prices of commodities and farmland. However, a few participants commented that business optimism had increased among contacts in their Districts, or that they were planning new capital expenditures.Participants observed that both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis. Participants continued to view inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome. Some participants noted that some factors, such as the decline in oil prices, slower growth and softer inflation abroad, or appreciation of the dollar last year, had held down some recent inflation readings and may continue to do so this year. In addition, many participants commented that upward pressures on inflation appeared to be more muted than they appeared to be last year despite strengthening labor market conditions and rising input costs for some industries.In their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations, participants noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months. Participants expressed a range of views in interpreting the decline in inflation compensation. On the one hand, that decline could stem from a decrease in expected inflation on the part of market participants. In that case, the current low levels of inflation compensation could suggest that inflation expectations are below the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. On the other hand, the decline in inflation compensation might reflect in large part declines in risk premiums or increased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for inflation. This interpretation was seen as consistent with the behavior of the most recent survey-based measures of expected inflation, which were little changed.In their discussion of labor markets, participants agreed that conditions had continued to strengthen. Estimates of job gains in the December employment report had been strong, the unemployment rate had remained low, and the labor force participation rate had moved up. Several participants noted solid rates of hiring or other indicators of tight labor market conditions in their Districts. Some participants commented on recent indicators at the national or District levels as suggesting a pickup in wage growth. The pickup was attributed to tightening in national or District labor market conditions or to gains in the rate of productivity growth. Continued solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor necessary to support rising real wages over time.Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. Participants noted that some risks to the downside had increased, including the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy stimulus, or a further tightening of financial market conditions. An increase in some foreign and domestic government policy uncertainties, including those associated with Brexit, an escalation in international trade policy tensions, and the potential for additional extended federal government shutdowns were also cited as downside risks. A few participants expressed concern that longer-run inflation expectations may be lower than levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective. Several participants judged that risks that could lead to higher-than-expected inflation had diminished relative to downside risks. The potential that various sources of uncertainty might abate more quickly than expected was mentioned as a potential upside risk for the economic outlook.In their discussion of financial developments, participants noted that although financial market conditions had not changed much, on net, over the intermeeting period, prices had been volatile and financial conditions were materially tighter than they had been several months ago, with lower equity prices and wider corporate risk spreads. Several participants also noted that the slope of the Treasury yield curve was unusually flat by historical standards, which in the past had often been associated with a deterioration in future macroeconomic performance. Participants noted that financial asset prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding trade policy tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary policy, and global economic growth prospects. A couple of participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over recent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future economic activity. Participants agreed that it was important to continue to monitor financial market developments and assess the implications of these developments for the economic outlook.Among those participants who commented on financial stability, a number expressed concerns about the elevated financial market volatility and the apparent decline in investors' willingness to bear risk that occurred toward the end of last year. Although these conditions had eased somewhat in recent weeks, a couple of participants noted that the strain in financial markets might have persisted or spread if it had occurred during a period of less favorable macroeconomic conditions. A couple of participants highlighted the role that decreased liquidity at the end of the year appeared to play in exacerbating changes in financial market conditions. They emphasized the need to monitor financial market structures or practices that may contribute to strained liquidity conditions. A few participants highlighted the importance of ensuring that financial institutions were able to withstand adverse financial market events--for instance, by maintaining adequate levels of capital.In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that information received since December indicated that real economic activity had been rising at a solid rate, labor market conditions had continued to strengthen, and inflation had been near the Committee's objective. Participants generally expected economic activity to continue expanding at a solid pace in the period ahead, with strong labor market conditions and inflation near 2 percent. At the time of the December meeting, the Committee had noted that it would continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook. Participants observed that since then, the economic outlook had become more uncertain. Financial market volatility had remained elevated over the intermeeting period, and, despite some easing since the December FOMC meeting, overall financial conditions had tightened since September. In addition, the global economy had continued to record slower growth, and consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated. The government policy environment, including trade negotiations and the recent partial federal government shutdown, was also seen as a factor contributing to uncertainty about the economic outlook.Based on their current assessments, all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2\\u00a0percent. With regard to the Committee's postmeeting statement, participants supported a proposed change in the forward guidance language that would replace the previous guidance referring to \\\"some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate\\\" with an indication that, in light of \\\"global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures,\\\" the Committee would \\\"be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate.\\\" Participants also supported a proposal to remove from the statement the characterization of risks to the economic outlook as \\\"roughly balanced.\\\"Participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook. With regard to the domestic economic picture, additional data would help policymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment, whether the recent softness in core and total inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on aggregate demand. Information arriving in coming months could also shed light on the effects of the recent partial federal government shutdown on the U.S. economy and on the results of the budget negotiations occurring in the wake of the shutdown, including the possible implications for the path of fiscal policy. A patient approach would have the added benefit of giving policymakers an opportunity to judge the response of economic activity and inflation to the recent steps taken to normalize the stance of monetary policy. Furthermore, a patient posture would allow time for a clearer picture of the international trade policy situation and the state of the global economy to emerge and, in particular, could allow policymakers to reach a firmer judgment about the extent and persistence of the economic slowdown in Europe and China.Participants noted that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks at this point. The current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate. Moreover, inflation pressures were muted, and asset valuations were less stretched than they had been a few months earlier. Many participants suggested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate later this year; several of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook. Several other participants indicated that, if the economy evolved as they expected, they would view it as appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year.Participants observed that a patient posture in these circumstances was consistent with their general approach to setting the stance of policy, in which they were importantly guided by the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook. Some participants noted that, while global economic and financial developments had been important factors leading to a patient monetary policy posture, those developments mattered because they affected assessments of the policy rate path most consistent with achievement of the Committee's dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. Many participants observed that if uncertainty abated, the Committee would need to reassess the characterization of monetary policy as \\\"patient\\\" and might then use different statement language.A few participants expressed concerns that in the current environment of increased uncertainty, the policy rate projections prepared as part of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) do not accurately convey the Committee's policy outlook. These participants were concerned that, although the individual participants' projections for the federal funds rate in the SEP reflect their individual views of the appropriate path for the policy rate conditional on the evolution of the economic outlook, at times the public had misinterpreted the median or central tendency of those projections as representing the consensus view of the Committee or as suggesting that policy was on a preset course. However, some other participants noted that the policy rate projections in the SEP are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook.Committee Policy ActionIn their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.In their consideration of the economic outlook, members noted that financial conditions had tightened, on net, since September, and that global growth had moderated; members also observed that a number of uncertainties, including those pertaining to the evolution of policies of the U.S. and foreign governments, still awaited resolution. However, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee's maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data.With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to change the characterization of recent growth in economic activity from \\\"strong\\\" to \\\"solid,\\\" consistent with incoming information that suggested that the pace of expansion of the U.S. economy had moderated somewhat since late last year. The description of indicators of inflation expectations was revised to recognize that the downward moves in market-based measures of inflation compensation that occurred in recent months had been sustained, while also noting that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Members also agreed to several adjustments in the description of the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. The statement language was revised to indicate that the Committee continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent as \\\"the most likely outcomes.\\\" Members also agreed to add a sentence indicating that, in light of \\\"global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.\\\" This sentence was intended to convey the Committee's view that a patient and flexible approach was appropriate at this time as a way to manage risks while assessing incoming information bearing on the economic outlook. In light of the range of uncertainties associated with global economic and financial developments, the Committee decided that it was not useful at this time to express a judgment about the balance of risks.At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Effective January 31, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.\\\"The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.:\\\"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.\\\"Voting for this action:Jerome H.

For\\nother forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors\\nare calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter.\\nPage 16 of 17\\nForecast Uncertainty \\nThe economic projections provided by the members of \\nthe Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal \\nReserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among \\npolicymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis \\nfor policy actions.  Considerable uncertainty attends these \\nprojections, however.  The economic and statistical models \\nand relationships used to help produce economic forecasts \\nare necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and \\nthe future path of the economy can be affected by myriad \\nunforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the \\nstance of monetary policy, participants consider not only \\nwhat appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-\\nbodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative \\npossibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-\\ntial costs to the economy should they occur. \\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a \\nrange of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary \\nPolicy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve \\nBoard\\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open \\nMarket Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges \\nshown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-\\nsociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a \\nparticipant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) \\nand total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, \\nrespectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-\\ntending those projections is similar to that experienced in the \\npast and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-\\nanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-\\nability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand \\nwithin a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year, 1.0 to \\n5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the \\nthird year.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence inter-\\nvals for overall inflation would be 0.6 to 3.4 percent in the \\ncurrent year and 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third \\nyears.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence \\nbounds in \\u201cfan charts\\u201d that are symmetric and centered on \\nthe medians of FOMC participants\\u2019 projections for GDP \\ngrowth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  However, in \\nsome instances, the risks around the projections may not be \\nsymmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be \\nnegative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projec-\\ntion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in \\nwhich case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet-\\nrically positioned around the median projection. \\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that \\nprevailed, on average, over history, participants provide \\njudgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their \\nprojections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller \\nthan, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-\\ntainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and \\nreflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in \\nthe top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants\\u2019 cur-\\nrent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- \\ntions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-\\nures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the \\nrisks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are \\nweighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, \\nwhile the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top \\npanels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-\\nticipants\\u2019 projections are balanced, participants may judge that \\nthere is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather \\nthan below their projections.  These judgments are summa-\\nrized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. \\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the \\nfuture path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable \\nuncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each \\nparticipant\\u2019s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-\\ntary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-\\ntivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve \\nin an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-\\nate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that \\npoint forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges \\nfor forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that \\nthe historical confidence intervals associated with projections \\nof the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, \\nhowever, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-\\nsistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these \\nprojections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-\\ncomes but rather are projections of participants\\u2019 individual as-\\nsessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-\\nof-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a \\nsense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal \\nfunds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-\\nnomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary \\npolicy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of \\nshocks to the economy. \\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval \\naround the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it \\nwould be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart \\nshown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target \\nrange for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the \\nCommittee in the past.  This approach to the construction of \\nthe federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; \\nit would not have any implications for possible future policy \\ndecisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-\\nvide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so \\nwere appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could \\nalso employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset \\npurchases, to provide additional accommodation. \\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on \\nthe uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 \\nprovides information on the range of views across FOMC \\nparticipants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A \\nthrough 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections \\nacross participants is much smaller than the average forecast \\nerrors over the past 20 years. \\nFor release at 2:00 p.m., EDT, March 19, 2025\\nPage 17 of 17\\n\",\n          \"For release at 2:00 p.m., EST, December 18, 2024\\nSummary of Economic Projections\\nIn conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on\\nDecember 17\\u201318, 2024, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most\\nlikely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment\\nrate, and in\\ufb02ation for each year from 2024 to 2027 and over the longer run.

Considerable uncertainty attends these \\nprojections, however.  The economic and statistical models \\nand relationships used to help produce economic forecasts \\nare necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and \\nthe future path of the economy can be affected by myriad \\nunforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the \\nstance of monetary policy, participants consider not only \\nwhat appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em-\\nbodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative \\npossibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten-\\ntial costs to the economy should they occur. \\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a \\nrange of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary \\nPolicy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve \\nBoard\\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open \\nMarket Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges \\nshown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as-\\nsociated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a \\nparticipant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) \\nand total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, \\nrespectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty at-\\ntending those projections is similar to that experienced in the \\npast and the risks around the projections are broadly bal-\\nanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob-\\nability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand \\nwithin a range of 2.2 to 3.8 percent in the current year, 1.3 to \\n4.7 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third \\nyear, and 0.7 to 5.3 percent in the fourth year.  The corre-\\nsponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla-\\ntion would be 1.7 to 2.3 percent in the current year, 0.4 to \\n3.6 percent in the second and third years, and 0.2 to 3.8 per-\\ncent in the fourth year.  Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate \\nthese confidence bounds in \\u201cfan charts\\u201d that are symmetric \\nand centered on the medians of FOMC participants\\u2019 projec-\\ntions for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla-\\ntion.  However, in some instances, the risks around the pro-\\njections may not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemploy-\\nment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around \\na particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or \\nthe downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart \\nwould be asymmetrically positioned around the median pro-\\njection. \\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that \\nprevailed, on average, over history, participants provide \\njudgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their \\nprojections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller \\nthan, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer-\\ntainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and \\nreflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in \\nthe top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants\\u2019 cur- \\nrent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-\\ntions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig-\\nures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the \\nrisks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are \\nweighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, \\nwhile the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top \\npanels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par-\\nticipants\\u2019 projections are balanced, participants may judge that \\nthere is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather \\nthan below their projections.  These judgments are summa-\\nrized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. \\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the \\nfuture path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable \\nuncertainty.  This uncertainty arises primarily because each \\nparticipant\\u2019s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone-\\ntary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac-\\ntivity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve \\nin an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri-\\nate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that \\npoint forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges \\nfor forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that \\nthe historical confidence intervals associated with projections \\nof the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, \\nhowever, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con-\\nsistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these \\nprojections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out-\\ncomes but rather are projections of participants\\u2019 individual as-\\nsessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-\\nof-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a \\nsense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal \\nfunds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco-\\nnomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary \\npolicy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of \\nshocks to the economy. \\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval \\naround the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it \\nwould be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart \\nshown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target \\nrange for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the \\nCommittee in the past.  This approach to the construction of \\nthe federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; \\nit would not have any implications for possible future policy \\ndecisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro-\\nvide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so \\nwere appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could \\nalso employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset \\npurchases, to provide additional accommodation. \\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on \\nthe uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 \\nprovides information on the range of views across FOMC \\nparticipants.  A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A \\nthrough 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections \\nacross participants is much smaller than the average forecast \\nerrors over the past 20 years. \\nFor release at 2:00 p.m., EST, December 18, 2024\\nPage 17 of 17\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
